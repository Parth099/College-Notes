Along the curve C we can take a tangent line to a point. The change in the $x$ and $y$ will be $dx$ and $dy$ respectively.

Note that $d\ell^2 = dx^2 + dy^2$
$$d\ell = \sqrt{dx^2 + dy^2}$$
$$d\ell = \sqrt{1 + (\frac{dy}{dx})^2} \mathop{dx}$$
$$L = \int_a^b \sqrt{1 + (\frac{dy}{dx})^2} \mathop{dx}$$

Note that we can solve for $dy$ instead if the equation to integrate was in the form $x = h(y)$
