# Vector Field
A Vector Field is a many-to-many relation with points on the plane and vectors at that point.

A Vector Field maps a vector to each point on the plane

A Vector Field example:
$$F(x, y, z) = \langle h(x, y, z), g(x, y, z), k(x, y, z) \rangle$$
Notice how it gives each point on the plane a Vector.
