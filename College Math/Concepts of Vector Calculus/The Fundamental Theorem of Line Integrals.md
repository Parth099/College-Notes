# The Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals

Statement: 
if $C$ is smooth on $a \leq t \leq b$ defined by $r(t)$ then:
$$\int_C \nabla f \cdot d\vec{r} = f(r(b)) - f(r(a))$$

Note: $\nabla f$  is the gradient of $f$

Recall FTOC

$$\int_a^b f^{\prime}(x) dx = f(b) - f(b)$$

The point here is that we are integrating a "derivative" and such the integral depends on the endpoints.
