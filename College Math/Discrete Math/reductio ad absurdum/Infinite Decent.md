# Impossibility of Infinite Decent in $\mathbb{Z}^+$

The chain of decreasing numbers in $\mathbb{N}$ or $\mathbb{Z}^+$ is **always** finite.

> **Axiom** / **Theorem**
> if $n_1 \gt n_2 \gt \dotso$ where $n_i\in\mathbb{Z}^+$ then this chain ends in a **finite** number of steps.

To see why choose a number like $5$ and see it's decreasing chain ends.
