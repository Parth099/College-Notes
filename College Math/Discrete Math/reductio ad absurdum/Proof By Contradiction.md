# Proof By Contradiction
Suppose we wish to prove a statement in the form 
$$A \to B$$

We start by assuming $\lnot B$. Then we argue till we reach a conclusion where either $A\equiv F$ or some well established fact is $\text{FALSE}$.

Since there exists a proof for the "established fact", we can conclude that $A \equiv F$
