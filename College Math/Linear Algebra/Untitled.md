# Diagonalization

Let A be an $n \times n$ matrix with $n$ eigen vectors

$$P^{-1}AP = D$$
Where D is the diagonal matrix with eigenvalues along the **main** diagonal corresponding to $P$'s vectors.

Notice that:
$$AP = [\lambda_1\vec{v}_1 \ ... \lambda_1\vec{n}_n]$$
As per notation, realize $\vec{v}_k$ is a $n \times 1$ vector.
