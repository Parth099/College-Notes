 Terms: 
 1. Model - An abstracted[^1] description of a process, object, or event. It highlights certain aspects at the expense of others.  
 2. Agent - An autonomous individual element with properties and actions in a computer simulation
 3. ABM[^2] - The idea that the world can be modeled using agents and their interactions. 

### Examples of ABMs
1. Companies
	+ If a an agent is said to be a company ABM will model interactions between organizations. 
2. Humans / Animals /etc
	+ Example is disease spread.
