# Week 2 - 01 26 23

> 01 24 23 only contained presentations and a recap of week 1

## Deterministic vs Stochastic Processes

1. Deterministic: Same ICs[^1] result in the same output
2. Stochastic Processes: based on randomness. Different result regardless of same ICs

> We need stochasticity to represent some variability in our model. This occurs often when humans are involved. 

The assigning of realistic initial values to our models depends on what the variable is and what distribution accurately represents it. 

### Common Distributions
1. Uniform: All values within a range $(a, b)$ are equally likely. 
2. Normal: Bell Curve
3. Log Normal: A random variable who's log is normally distributed. 
4. Binomial


## Monte Carlo Simulation

> Simulation based on random sampling

We simulate the experiment and measure outcome variables to obtain a statistical distribution of the measurements. 

We can look at many things for analysis. 

### Mean

$$
\bar{x} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N x_i
$$

### Median

The midpoint of the dataset.

### Mode and Histograms

We can look at a histogram to look at frequency of values per a small range and the mode to determine the *most* frequent element. 

### Variance

> Measures the spread of the data

$$
S^2 = \frac{1}{N-1} \sum_{i=1}^{N}  {(x_i - \bar{x})^2}
$$

### STD DEV (Standard Deviation)

+ sqrt of Variance (above)
+ best measure of spread

### Range

$$\text{Range} = \max - \min$$
