# Chapter 1 - Complex Adaptive Systems

## Terms
1. **Stigmergy** - The indirect influence of agents via the change in the environment. 
	+ Example: People leaving reviews on products online leading to higher sales of the product
2. **Emergence** - a macro-level event resulting from low level events
	+ macro-level event can only be derived from studying the effects of micro-level agents' behavior.  
	+ Examples:
		+ If people see a shorter path over a greenfield rather than using the sidewalk the resulting tracks increase the chance of the next person using that trial over the grass. 
		+ Mexican Waves: at a performance people may stand up to clap. When they sit back down it results in other people sitting back down resulting in a *human-wave*.

> micro-level agents do not make decisions based on macro-level decisions

3. Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) can be used to study emergence events; CAS refer to a group of agents responding to the actions of other agents. 
	+ Examples
		+ Stock Markets
		+ Immune Systems
		+ Pandemics
		+ Ecosystems


## Bali Irrigation
Farmers in Bali have to deal with pests that destroy rice as well as a water shortage. 

One form of pest control is to coordinating with nearby farmers to plant rice at the same time[^1] however recall there is a water shortage. If too few farmers partake pests could *migrate* to a field and eat the rice there and then migrate back to eat the rice again. If too many farmers plant at the same time the water system will be overloaded.  



[^1]: no food for pests if its still growing
