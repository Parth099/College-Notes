# Chapter 02

## Terms
1. Epistemology: branch of philosophy that deals with knowledge and the methods of obtaining knowledge.  

## Models
> **Simplification of reality**; A modeler has to decide what to leave out or leave in. 


### Newtonian Approach
Any system can be forecasted like a clock if we have the right model. This means that given the correct model, we can predict the future.  It is named "Newtonian" since most physics models are this way such as predicting the movement of space objects

### Complex Adaptive Approach
Opposite of ***Newtonian Approach***. 

### Deductive / Inductive Reasoning
#### Inductive
Inductive reasoning is "bottom-up". This is when you observe something from its starting point. An example of this is when a researcher follows a bird around for years and then comparing it to other birds. 

> Observation -> Pattern -> Tentative[^1] Hypothesis -> Theory

Inductive is when you don't know what you are looking for. You may observe some patterns and want to learn more to explain them. 

#### Deductive
Deductive reasoning is the opposite. One **starts with a theory** on a topic of interest and then defines hypothesis(s) to test it. 

> Theory -> Hypothesis -> observation -> confirmation (*result*)

The results then may or may not confirm the hypothesis(s).  

#### Deductive / Inductive and Modeling
Some researchers may model from a data set taken from another study as a starting point. Then they may develop a model to fit the data which can serve as a starting point for theories later. (Inductive)

A Deductive model would start with some known rules. Then it would be run to see which patterns emerge. Notice this is like asking which developed theories would be correct.  

### Dynamics and Scale

Many things cannot be measured accurately such as the change of 
people minds. Social change can only be measured indirectly.

For example, if we ask the same person to fill out the same survey some $t$ time apart the responses may change. 

Another difficulty is selecting an entity (individual, couples, families) and the modeling the complex relations between said entities. This is the scale of the system. 

## Modeling Process
1. Define a scope (what questions do you want to address)
2. Check if the model can be developed with current statistical data
3. Define agent attributes and interactions
	+ The challenge here is keeping the model simple. 
4. Review existing literature. 

One could also develop a model and let it run to *observe* *patterns* that develop. 

### Model Components
