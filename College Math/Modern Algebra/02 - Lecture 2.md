## $\gcd$

Let $a, b\in\mathbb{Z}$ where both are not zero[^1]. The largest $d\in\mathbb{Z}$ such that $d|a$ and $d|b$ is the $\gcd(a, b)$. Also written as $d=(a,b)$

Remarks:
+ $d\gt0$
+ $\gcd(a, 0) = |a|$

## Theorem 1.2

Let $a, b\in\mathbb{Z}$ where both are not zero[^1]. Then $\exists u, v\in\mathbb{Z}$ s.t $(a, b)=an+bv$









[^1]: One of them can be. If both zero the greatest common divisor is not defined since zero has infinite divisors.
