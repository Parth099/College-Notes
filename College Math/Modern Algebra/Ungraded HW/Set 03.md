## 1.2.8

> Prove that $(n, n + 1) = 1$ for every integer $n$.

Assume $d=\gcd(n, n+1)$ thus, $d|n$ and $d|n+1$ .

Since $d|n$ and $d|n+1$ it implies that $d|1$. 

Since $d$ divides $1$ it means that $d$ is either $\pm 1$ .

Since $d\gt0$ , $d=1$

Therefore, $\gcd(n, n+1) = 1$ for any $n \in \mathbb{Z}$
