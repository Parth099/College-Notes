# Set 9

## 2.2.14

> Show that if $p$ is prime, the only solutions of $x^2+x=[0]$ in $\mathbb{Z}_p$ are $[0], [p-1]$

> ***Theorem 2.8***
> For a prime $p>1$ whenever $bc=0$ in $\mathbb{Z}_p$ then $b=0$ or $c=0$

Notice[^1] $x^2+x = x(x+1)$ 

Using theorem 2.8 we can see that either:
+ $x+1=[0]$ which is the same as $x=[-1]=[p-1]$
+ $x=[0]$
