# Bisection Method
- Iteratively finds a root $p$ for a function $f$ on a continuous interval $[a, b]$  

## IVT:
If $f$ is continuous on $[a, b]$ and $f(a)f(b) \lt 0$ then $\exists p$ s.t $f(p) = 0$  

## Algorithm

Each $p_n$ generated by the bisection algorithm is a approximation for $p$

```text
Let a_1 = a
Let b_1 = b

p_1 = (a_1 + b_1) / 2 = a_1 + (b_1 - a_2) / 2

if(p_1 == 0) END, RETURN p_1 as the root

if(a_1 and p_1 have the same sign)
	redo steps with a_2 = p_1, b_2 = b_1
else 
	redo steps with a_2 = a_1, b_2 = p_1
```

Notice with each iteration that the interval grows smaller by an order of 2. 

More formally, 
$$
\biggr| p_n - p \biggr| \leq \frac{b-a}{2^n} \text{ for } n\geq 1 \implies p_n = p + O\biggr(\frac{1}{2^n}\biggr)
$$

This just says that as you complete more iterations the difference between $p$ and $p_n$ grows smaller by a order of $2$. 

Note this bound is quite loose, the actual error can be much smaller. 

### Example Given in class

$$f(x) = x^5 - 4x + 1$$

+ Part 1:
	+ Show $\exists x_0$ s.t $f(x_0) = 0$ where $x_0 \in [0,1]$
+ Part 2: 
	+ Use the bisection method to find a root such that the error is less than $10^{-3}$


So we did it the numerical way in class which took $n = 2$ iterations to find a valid $x_0$. 

We can also use the bound to find how many iterations it will take:
We require that 
$$
\frac{b-a}{2^n} = \frac{1}{2^n} \lt 10^{-3}
$$

$$
\begin{align}
	\frac{1}{2^n} \lt 10^{-3} \implies 2^n \gt 1000
\end{align}
$$

Since we know that $2^{10} = 1024$ and $n\in\mathbb{Z}^+$, the bound states we need 10 iterations to attain the accuracy we need.
