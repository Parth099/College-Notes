# Lecture 10 27 22 - Intro to Linear 
We learned about the allowable operations and solved a few systems. 
1. Scale $(\lambda E_i) \to E_i$
2. Replacement $(E_i + \lambda E_j) \to E_j$
3. Swap $E_i \leftrightarrow E_j$

## Augmented Matrix

$$
[\ A\ |\ b \ ] = 
\begin{bmatrix}
a_{11}x_1 & \dotso & a_{1n}x_1 & a_{i, n+1} \\
\vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots\\
a_{11}x_1 & \dotso & a_{1n}x_1 & a_{i, n+1} \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Where $b$ is represented as that last column. 

## 'Computerized' Algorithm to solve Linear Systems

> For simplicity we assume unique solutions and no swapping required. 

Input: $\hat{A} = [A|B]$ where $\hat{A}\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times(n+1)}$

We will use $a_{ij}$ to reference entries of $\hat{A}$ .

### To Row Echelon Form (Elimination)
```python
for i in range(1, n): #n is not hit (we do not reduce last row)
	# we need to reference the last col
	for j in range(i + 1, n + 1): 
	m_ij = a_ij / a_ii #reduction factor
	# need to access b's column in aug_mat
	for k in range(i + 1, n + 2):
		a_jk -= (mij * a_ik)
```

At this point our matrix is in upper triangle form. 

### Back Substitution
Notice that we do not need to resolve the last row at the end of the Elimination routine. 

For the last row we can find the $x_n$ via:

$$
x_n = \frac{a_{n, n+1}}{a_{nn}}
$$

```python
for i in range(i - 1, 0): #i - 1, ..., 1
	x_i = a_{i, n+1}
	for j in range(i + 1, n + 1): #access each col but not n+1th col
		x_i -= a_ij * x_j
	x_i /= a_ii
```

We are building the solution vector $\vec{v}$ from the bottom up as we have the bottom value $x_n$ trivially from the Elimination procedure.
