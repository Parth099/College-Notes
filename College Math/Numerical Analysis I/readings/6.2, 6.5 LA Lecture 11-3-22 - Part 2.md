# 6.2, 6.5 LA Lecture 11-3-22 - Row Interchanges
Let $A^k$ be the matrix at the beginning of step $k$ of Gaussian Elimination. 

Therefore we are attempting to set $a^k_{k+1, k}, \dotso, a^k_{n, k}$ to **zero**. 

This means $\forall j\in\{k+1,\dotso ,n\}, m_{jk}=\frac{a^k_{jk}}{a^k_{kk}}$ for $a^k_{kk} \neq 0$

If $m_{ij} >> 1$ it will call massive round off error. This occurs when $a^k_{kk}$ is small. Therefore we *swap rows* to make $a^k_{kk}$ as large as possible to make $m_{ij}$ small. 

## Partial Pivoting
To reduce error:

In step $k$ of Gaussian Elimination, 

We need to swap row $k$ with the row where the largest $|a^k_{pk}|$  is found. 

$$
|a^k_{pk}| = \max_{k\leq i\leq n}|a^k_{i, k}|
$$

**Permutation Matrix**

A Permutation Matrix has only a single `1` in each row. They are used to swap rows in a matrix when multiplied from the left. 

$$
P=
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 \\
1 & 0 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Above, $P$ is a Permutation Matrix that swaps the rows of any $2\times 2$ matrix. 

With interchanges we obtain this factorization:

$$
PA = LU \to A = P^{-1}Lu
$$

For any permutation matrix, its inverse is its transpose:

$$
P^{-1} = P^T
$$

What is a **transpose**?

For all elements $a_{ij} = a_{ji}$

So why is $P^{-1} = P^{T}$ ?

See that if $P_{ij} = 1$ we are moving row $i$ to row $j$. To revert this change we require moving the rows back: $j\to i$. This means that $P^{-1}_{ji}=1$
