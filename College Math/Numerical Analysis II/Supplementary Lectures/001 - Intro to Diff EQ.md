# Intro to Diff EQs

+ A differential equation tries to model change. 
+ A differential equation relates derivatives
+ Solutions are no longer numbers, they are functions.
+ Solutions are usually an infinite family of equations that satisfy a differential equation
	+ The order $n$ of a differential equation is the highest order derivative present in the equation. As $n$ increases the number of arbitrary constants also goes up (think integration). 
	+ An initial condition (IC) will determine a particular solution.
