# Solving with Integrals

This method is for differential equations that do not depend on anything but the independent variable. 

$$
\dfrac{dy}{dx} = f(x) \ \} \text{- no } y 
$$

Note this can be rewritten as:

$$
dy = f(x)\mathop{dx}
$$

You can integrate on both sides:

$$
\int dy = \int f(x) \mathop{dx} = \underbrace{F(x) + C}_{\text{family of curves}}
$$

> An IC (initial condition/value) **is required** to select a particular curve.

## Example 1

$$
\dfrac{dy}{dx} = (x-2)^2
$$

$$
\int \frac{dy}{\cancel{dx}} \mathop{\cancel{dx}} = \int (x-2)^2 \mathop{dx} \implies y = \frac{1}{3}(x-2)^3 + C
$$

Additional examples are not present since the idea is elementary.
