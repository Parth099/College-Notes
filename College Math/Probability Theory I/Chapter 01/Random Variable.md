> A Random variable is a variable whose values depend on the outcomes of a random event.

It maps the sample space to a measurable space
In other words the mapping is usually from objects in the sample space to numbers.   

The takeaway is that random variables **DO NOT** take on values but only serve to map a sample space to a numerical output.
$$X:\Omega \to \mathbb{R}^n$$
