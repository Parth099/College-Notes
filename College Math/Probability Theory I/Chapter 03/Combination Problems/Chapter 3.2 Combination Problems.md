Trials = $n$
$p$-value = $.5$
success = .7($n$)
$$
\begin{align*}
	&n = 10 \to j = 7 \\
	&\text{We need 70\% or better}\\
	&\sum_{i = 0}^{n(1-j)}b(10, 0.5, 7+i)

$$
\begin{align*}
&s = .7(n) \\
&n = 10 \to &\sum_{i = s}^{n}b(10, 0.5, s) &\approx .1719\\
&n = 30 \to &\sum_{i = s}^{n}b(30, 0.5, s) &\approx .0214\\
&n = 50 \to &\sum_{i = s}^{n}b(50, 0.5, s) &\approx .0033\\

\end{align*}
$$
Notice how the chance is lower for higher numbers. This is because each question *will* carry less weight and this a 70\% is harder to attain.

### a) Royal Flush
Ways to pick a suit $\binom{4}{1}$
Each suit has only 1 Royal Flush
$$\text{Answer: }\frac{\binom{4}{1}}{\binom{52}{5}}$$
#### Alternate Method
We need cards $10-A$ and there are $\frac{5 * 4}{52}$ ways to pick the first card.

Now we have a suit:
The next cards will have chances $\frac{4}{51}$, $\frac{3}{50}$, $\frac{2}{49}$, $\frac{1}{48}$
$$\text{Answer: }\frac{20}{52}\frac{4}{51}\frac{3}{50}\frac{2}{49}\frac{1}{48}$$
### b) Straight Flush
Ways to pick a suit $\binom{4}{1}$
Ways to have a SF sequence: $10$
It is $10$ because $J, Q, K$ cannot start a flush
Looked it up online

We then subtract the 4 sequences $\{10, J, Q, K, A\}$ per suit.
$$\frac{40 - \binom{4}{1}}{\binom{52}{5}}$$

### c) Four of a Kind
Ways to pick a Rank: $\binom{13}{1}$
There are 13 ranks.

Each rank as 4 cards which we need to all select so that will only have 1 way.

Then we select the last card which will be $\binom{48}{1}$ since we have removed 4 cards by now

$$\frac{\binom{13}{1}\binom{4}{4}\binom{48}{1}}{\binom{52}{5}}$$

### d) 
How many pairs are there?
There are $\binom{4}{2}$ to select a suit and then $\binom{13}{1}$ ways to pick a pair. We need 2 suits and then one of the 13 cards.

How many triples?
There are $\binom{4}{3}$ ways to pick a suit now. **But** now there is $\binom{12}{1}$ ways to pick a card since making the pair removed the possibility of a triple of that type.

$$\text{\# doubles } *\text{\# triples} = 3,744$$

$$\frac{\binom{4}{2}\binom{4}{3}\binom{13}{1}\binom{12}{1}}{\binom{52}{5}}$$

## 13

*All we need* to show here is that 
$$\frac{C}{n!n!}$$
is the largest where $n!n!$ is the smallest denominator 
$$
\text{Observe: }
\binom{2n}{n+k} = \frac{(2n)!}{(n+k)!(2n-n-k)!} = \frac{(2n)!}{(n+k)!(n-k)!} 
$$

$$
\text{Examine }
n!n! = n^2\times(n-1)^2\times \cdots \times 2^2 \times 1^2
$$

$$(n+k)!(n-k)! = (n+k)(n+k-1)\cdots(n-k)(n-k-1)\cdots(2)(1)$$

$n = 3$
$p = .300$
$j = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}$

$$
\begin{align*}
	\text{0 Hits } &= \binom{3}{3}(.3)^{0}(.7)^{3} &= .343 \\
	\text{1 Hits } &= \binom{3}{1}(.3)^{1}(.7)^2 &= .441 \\
	\text{2 Hits } &= \binom{3}{2}(.3)^{2}(.7)^1 &= .189 \\
	\text{3 Hits } &= \binom{3}{2}(.3)^{3}(.7)^0 &= .027 \\
\end{align*}
$$

## 16

Let $A$ be an eight element set where each element represents a game. 

Picking $3$ elements from $A$ to be winning games is $\binom{8}{3}$
Picking $3$ losses elements is $\binom{5}{3}$

Now lets look at the other side:
$$8! \text{ Ways to arrange 8 objects}$$
Divide by $3!3!$ as there are 3 loss elements and 3 win.
Divide by $2!$ as there are 2 ways to have a tie.

See that
$$\binom{8}{3}\binom{5}{3} = \frac{8!}{3!5!}\frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{8!}{3!3!2!}$$

## 17 
![[p17.png]]
Ways to put $a$ objects from $n$ in a box: $\binom{n}{a}$
Putting in the next k items: $\binom{n-a}{k}$

$$\binom{n}{a}\binom{n-a}{b}\binom{n-a-b}{c}=\frac{n!}{a!(n-a)!}\frac{(n-a)!}{b!(n-a-b)!}\frac{(n-a-b)!}{c!(n-a-b-c)}$$

$$\text{NOTE: }n-a-b-c = 0, 0! = 1$$

Thus RHS boils down to:
$$
\frac{n!}{a!b!c!}
$$
## 22
![[p22.png]]
### Analysis
$\#22$ is different from regular problems because we require the combination to output different sized sets. Usually we ask the question: How many ways can $n$ *distinct* items be put into $k$ groups. However this question is fundamentally different we wish to ask how many ways we can put $n$ *distinct* items where the number of groups and items in groups vary. 
### Solution
Consider The diagram.
$|LL|LLL|L|$
See that between the first and last $|$ there are 8 slots that are either $L$s or $|$.

Simply put we need to choose 2 spots and the rest can be $L$s. 
$$\text{Answer: }\binom{8}{2} = 28$$

## 31

For not a safe landing we need $3$ or $4$ engines to malfunction.
$$P(\text{Malfunction}) = \frac{1}{100}$$
$$
\begin{align*}
	b(4, .01, 3) + b(4, .01, 4) &= \binom{4}{3}(.01)^{3}(.99)+\binom{4}{4}(.01)^{4} \\
	&= 3.96 \times 10^{-6}
\end{align*}
$$
If that is the $P(\text{Malfunction})$ then $P(\text{NOT Malfunction})$ is
$$1-3.96 \times 10^{-6} = \boxed{0.99999605}$$

Alternate Solution:
$$b(4,.99, 4)+b(4,.99, 3)+b(4,.99, 2)$$

## Special Problems
![[sp7.png]]
Successive Increasing Ratio:
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{b(n, p, j)}{b(n, p, j-1)} &= \frac{\binom{n}{j}p^jq^{n-j}}{\binom{n}{j-1}p^{j-1}q^{n-(j+1)}} \\

&= \frac{p}{q}\frac{\binom{n}{j}}{\binom{n}{j-1}} \\

&= \frac{p}{q}\frac{\frac{n!}{(n-j)!j!}}{\frac{n!}{(n-j+1)!(j-1)!}} \\

&= \frac{p}{q}\frac{(n-j+1)!(j-1)!}{(n-j)!j!} \\

&= \frac{p}{q}\frac{n-j+1}{j} \\
\end{align*}
