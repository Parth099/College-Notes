# Important Distributions and Densities
For: [[Probability Theory 1]]
## Discrete Uniform Distribution
Occurs when the **all** outcomes of an experiment are equally likely. This means $X$ is uniformly distributed. Let $S$ be the sample space for this distribution, then $S$ is:
$$0 \lt |S| \lt \infty$$
The distribution function $m(\omega)$ for this case is simply $\frac{1}{|S|}$ for all $\omega\in S$. 

## Binomial Uniform Distribution
