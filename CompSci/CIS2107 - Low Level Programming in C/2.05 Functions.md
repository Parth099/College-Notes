# Functions in **C**
The goal of functions is to decouple the `main` function. Functions also make the code more developer friendly. 

## Function Prototype
In C there exists something known as a `Function Prototype`. 
Imagine we have a `square` function. 
```c
int square(int y){
	return y * y;
} 
```
we must have the prototype at the top as 
```c
int square(int y);
```
We need to inform the compiler of the functions that exist below the main. This is also know as a function signature. 

## Format Specifiers
![[format_spec.png]]
We should try to use the smallest data-type every time. 

## `rand()`
The random function is located in the standard library: `<stdlib.h>`. The `rand` picks a number from 0 to the largest int possible on the **machine** you are on. The distribution is *uniform*. 

Suppose we wanted a range the range was **\[1, 6\]** 

We do:
```c
1 + (rand() % 6);
```
This is because `rand() % 6` will produce \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}. The `+1` will shift the set by 1.
 ### Seeding for `rand()`
 This is the number that `rand` will use to generate random numbers. 
 
 When using the same seed for $n$ random number generations, the two sequences will be the same.
 This means that if we choose $67$ as our seed and generate 10 numbers many times, they will all be the same. 
 
 To set the seed we use:
 ```c
 srand(seed); //seed is ab INT
 ```
 This is still an issue since the `seed` can be reversed engineered.
 
To solve this we first make note of the `time` function from `<time.h>`

```c
time_t time( time_t *second ); //function signature
```
If call `time` with `NULL` like:
```c
time(NULL);
```
A `time_t` object is returned with the time in *seconds* from  `00:00:00 UTC, January 1, 1970`. `NULL` is a preprocessor constant value.   

Since the time changes *every* second. The rand will be *mildly* random. 

## `enum` : Enumerations
```c
enum Status = {CONTINUE, WON, LOST}; //{0, 1, 2}
```
Each variable is **constant Integer**(its why they are upper-case). It cannot be changed. `enum` serves to make your `c` program more readable.

`enum` is declared outside of `main()`

The `enum` starts at $0$ and increments by $1$ per var.
### Using `enum` vars
To create a var to hold the value of an `enum` we use in functions:
```c
int main(void){
	//code....
	enum Status gameStatus;
	//code...
}
```
The var `gameStatus` can **only** contain the vars `CONTINUE, WON, LOST`.

Ex:
```c
if(...){
	Status = WON;
}
```

The `datatype` for `gameStatus` is `enum Status`**!**

### Using `enum` vars in conditionals
We must use 
```c
while(CONTINUE == gameStatus){//...}
```

## New Var Scoping
We can define a global vars by using the same declarations **outside** of `main()`. 
Ex
```c
//preprocesses
//func sigs

//A
int x = 15; 

int main(void){
	//B
	int x = 5; //new local var 
	{
		//C
		int x = 7; //local var to new spoce 
		
	}

}
```
`x` can now be accessed by **any** function.
See scopes in C for more info.

When trying to access to variable, we find the closest one. So if we try to get `x` from point $C$ we will get the value $7$ or $5$ if we try from point $B$. If there is no `x` in scope we attempt to fetch from global scope. The 3 `x` vars here share **no** connections.

This because the deepest `var` is pushed into the stack for execution.

The example given in class is with Human names, are all people named `Tom` the same person?
## Keyword `static`
vars with the `static` datatype do not exist in the same space as non-`static` vars. They are `init` only once.
```c
void func(){ 
	static int x = 50;
	x++;
	printf("x: %d\n", x);
}
```
Once declared they retain their value even when out of scope. So if we do:
```c
int main(void){
	func();
	func();
}
/*
It prints:
x : 51;
x : 52;
*/
```
The var will **not** be reset to 50 every time `func` is called. Essentially, `static` will tell the compiler the var is in a diff location called `BSS/DATA`.

## \_Bool Datatype
The C standard has a boolean type represented by the keyword \_Bool which can only be set to 0 or 1.
This is contained in the `<stdbool.h>`
Ex:
```c
#include <stdbool.h>

int main(void) {
	bool isExample = true;
}
```
