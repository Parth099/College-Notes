# Null and Void Pointers
`null` is a special reserved value while `void` is a type.

More formally, each specific pointer type (`int *`, `char *`, etc) has its own dedicated `null` value. When a pointer has the `null` value, it is **not** pointing anywhere.

The **actual** value of `null` is ***System Dependent***. 

Creating a "dangling pointer" that is not initialized to any value (`null` or otherwise) is a "billion dollar mistake."

## `void *` Pointer
`void *`, is a real pointer type much like `int *` . We use a `void *` when we do not know what datatype to use until runtime. We can typecast `void *` into something we need.

```c
void *pointer = null;
```

**Important:** A `void` pointer can hold the address of *any* datatype but cannot be *dereference*.

Hence, this code will cause an error:
```c
int main(void)
{
	char c = 'a';
	void *vPtr = &c;
	printf("c = %c", *vPtr);
}
```

> **Summary**: 
> `void *` is a pointer *type* while `null` is a *value*. 


## `Null` vs `'\0'` vs `0`
All three define the meaning of `"0"` in different contexts. 

### Usage:

| Context | Use This     |
| ------- | ------------ |
| Pointer | `NULL`       |
| String  | `\0` (`NUL`) |

Each has a different address in memory.
