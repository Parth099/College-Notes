# Structs
A **C Structure** is a collection of different data-types which are group together, these variables are called members.

To access data of a `struct` we **must** initialize it first.

## Creating Structs Example - Non-Pointer EX
### Syntax
```c
struct student{
	int mark; //4 byes
	char name[10]; //10 bytes
	float average; //4 bytes
}
```
This `struct` reserves `18` bytes of memory when created. The declared variable is like an array, it holds the address to the first memory location of the `struct` . 

### Declaration
```c
struct student report;
```
The variable `report` is of type `struct student`

### Initialization and Access
```c
struct student report = {100, "Navraj", 99.99};
```

```c
report.mark;    //100
report.name     //"Navraj"
report.average; //99.99
```

## Structs via Pointer Declaration
The syntax is the same
```c
struct student{
	int mark; //4 byes
	char name[10]; //10 bytes
	float average; //4 bytes
}
```

### Declaration and Initialization
```c
struct student *report, rep;
```
`*report` is a `struct student` pointer. 

```c
struct student{
 int id;
 char name[20];
 float percentage;
} record;
//record is global here

int main(){
    //declare
    struct student *report;
    struct student rep = {100, "Navraj", 99.99};
    report = &rep;

    printf("Name: %s\n", report->name); //Name: Navraj
}
```
`report` now points to `rep` .

### Access via Pointer
`->`(->) is the arrow operator. 

```c
report -> mark;
report -> name;
report -> average;
```

We cannot do `name.key` .

## Example
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

struct student
{
	int id;
	char name[20];
	float percentage;
}

int main()
{
	struct student record = {0};//init to Null
	//all values to nullified
	
	record.id = 1;
	strcpy(record.name, "Navraj");
	//string copy (dest, target) from string.h
	
	record.persentage = 85.9;
	
	printf("Id: %d\n", record.id);
	printf("Name: %s\n", record.name);
	
}
```
We use the dot-operator for **both** assignment and retrieval. 

## `struct` in Header files
It is recommended that we put `struct`s in header-files that you create
```c
#include <stdio.h> //sys defined
#include "structures.h" //user defined
```

> **Note**: Each file in a system is a `struct` .

In `"structures.h"` we can define this:
```c
struct student{
	int id;
	char name[30];
} record;
```

and then simply import it. 
Notice after importing it we can just use `record`.

## Use of Structs
In Unix everything is a File, yet in C every thing is a struct thus all files can be viewed as a `struct`. 
Structures act as a database, senders of data and IO interactors. (much more than this.)

## `struct` Array
```c
struct student{
	int id;
	char name[20];
	float percentage;
};

int main(){
	//declare
	struct student record[3];
	
	//assign example
	record[1].id = 15;
	strcpy(record[1].name, "Navraj");
	record[1].percentage = 100.00;
	//we can do this for any defined index
	
	//print example
	printf("Name:  %s\nid: %d", record[1].name ,record[1].id);
}
```

The array only holds the pointer to the struct **not** the struct itself. This is because we need the array to hold contiguous blocks.

## Passing Structs to functions
A `struct` can be passed to **any** function. 
We can declare a global struct if we wish to create a unscoped `struct` that **does not** need to be passed around. 

We can pass a `struct` via passing by value or *pointer* or making it global. 

### Pass by **Value**
```c
//proto
void print(struct student record);

int main(){
	struct student record;
	//create student and assign values
	//...
	print(record);
}

void print(struct student record){
	//print the record
	printf("Id: %d\n", record.id);
	printf("Name: %s\n", record.name);
	printf("Percent: %f", record.percentage);
}
```

**Important:** `print(record);` makes the OS copy the `record` and then pass it over. Thus they have different addresses when checking.

### Pass by **reference**
```c
//proto
void print(struct student *something);

int main(){
	struct student record;
	//create student and assign values
	//...
	print(&record);
}

void print(struct student *something){
	//print the record
	printf("Id: %d\n", something->id);
	printf("Name: %s\n", something->name);
	printf("Percent: %f\n", something->percentage);
}
```

Now they both are the same `struct`, the OS does not copy a new struct. 

### Global `struct`s
```c
struct student{
	int id;
	char name[20];
	float percentage;
};

struct student record;

int main(void){
	record.id = 17;
}
```
or
```c
struct student{
	int id;
	char name[20];
	float percentage;
} record;

int main(void){
	record.id = 17;
}
```
Then, `record` is *global*. `record` can be accessed from anywhere. 

## Copying 	`struct`s
Ways to do it:
1. `s1 = s2`
2. inbuilt `memcpy()`
3. Copying individual attrs. 

### Method 1
If we have
```c
int main(){

    struct student s1, s2;
    //s1 = {1, "Nav", 100}; //causes are error if we try to init after init
    s1.id = 1;
    strcpy(s1.name, "NAV");
    s1.percentage = 100;
	//copies it over
    s2 = s1;
}
```
This will copy `s1` into `s2`. This is **not** a shallow copy. They each have different pointers and addresses. 

This action of copying has been optimized to be fast on most OSs.

### Method 2
```c
#include <string.h> //for memcpy
int main(){
    struct student s1 = {1, "Nav", 100}, *s3, *ptr1;

    //copies it over
    ptr1 = &s1;
    memcpy(s3, ptr1, sizeof(s1));
    //sz = 38
    //see that s3 is a pointer
    printf("ID: %s", s3->name);
}
```
Copies the contents of `ptr1` to `s3`.
It needs the `size` to copy over **all** the contents byte by byte. 

This is the *best* way to copy `strcut`s.

## Nested Structure

### Regular Internal
#important
```c
struct college
{
	int college_id;
	char collage_name[50];
};

//sizeof is 82
struct student
{
	int id;
	char name[20];
	float percentage;
	//!
	struct college clg_data;
}
```

```c
int main(){
	struct student sd = {1, "nav", 90.95, 22, "TU"};
	
	//printing
	printf("College Name: %s", sd.clg_data.college_name);
}
```

While student has only 3 elements the last 2 assign to the internal `college struct` 

### Pointer Internals
```c
struct college
{
	int college_id;
	char college_name[50];
};

struct student
{
	int id;
	char name[20];
	float percentage;
	//!
	struct college clg_data;
};
```

```c
int main(){

 struct student sd = {1, "nav", 90.95, 22, "TU"};
 struct student *sd_ptr;
 sd_ptr = &sd;

 printf("College Name: %s", sd_ptr->clg_data.college_name); 

}
```

This is because `college_data` in `struct student` is **not** a `struct` pointer. If it were we could write
```c
sd_ptr->clg_data->college_name;
```
