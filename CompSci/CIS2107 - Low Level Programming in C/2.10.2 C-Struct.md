# Structs
A **C Structure** is a collection of different data-types which are group together, these variables are called members.

To access data of a `struct` we **must** initialize it first.

## Creating Structs Example - Non-Pointer EX
### Syntax
```c
struct student{
	int mark; //4 byes
	char name[10]; //10 bytes
	float average; //4 bytes
}
```
This `struct` reserves `18` bytes of memory when created. The declared variable is like an array, it holds the address to the first memory location of the `struct` . 

### Declaration
```c
struct student report;
```
The variable `report` is of type `struct student`

### Initialization and Access
```c
struct student report = {100, "Navraj", 99.99};
```

```c
report.mark;    //100
report.name     //"Navraj"
report.average; //99.99
```

## Structs via Pointer Declaration
The syntax is the same
```c
struct student{
	int mark; //4 byes
	char name[10]; //10 bytes
	float average; //4 bytes
}
```

### Declaration and Initialization
```c
struct student *report, rep;
```
`*report` is a `struct student` pointer. 

```c
struct student *report, rep;
rep = {100, "Navraj", 99.99};
report = &rep;
```
`report` now points to `rep` .

### Access via Pointer
`->`(->) is the arrow operator. 

```c
report -> mark;
report -> name;
report -> average;
```

We cannot do `name.key` .

## Example
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

struct student
{
	int id;
	char name[20];
	float percentage;
}

int main()
{
	struct student record = {0}//init to Null
	//all values to nullified
	
	record.id = 1;
	strcpy(record.name, "Navraj");
	//string copy (dest, target) from string.h
	
	record.persentage = 85.9;
	
	printf("Id: %d\n", record.id);
	printf("Name: %s\n", record.name);
	
}
```
We use the dot-operator for **both** assignment and retrieval. 

## `struct` in Header files
It is recommended that we put `struct`s in header-files.


```c
#include <stdio.h> //sys defined
#inclide "structures.h" //user defined
```

> **Note**: Each file in a system is a `struct` .
