# C-Struct Memory Allocation
Much like arrays elements are **contiguous**.
## Example
```c
struct student
{
	int id1;
	int id2;
	char a;
	char b;
	float percent;
}
```

Why is the total size not 14 like we would have added?

Notice that addresses `675376778, 675376778` are absent. This is know as padding.

The reason why the slots are empty is because we ask for memory in units of `4 bytes`. We cannot ask for a number of bytes that are not a multiple of four. 

See that `id1`, `id2` take up the first two slots of `4 bytes`. The `percent` takes up the last slot. Now the two `char` variables are put into a 4 byte container *padded* with 2 extra bytes which are **left empty**. 

```c
//we can only trust sizeof operator
sizeof(S); //S is a struct
```

## Rearrangement
Recall how the struct from above was `16` bytes.
This *same* struct is `20` bytes.
```c
struct student
{
	int id1;
	char a;
	int id2;
	char b;
	float percent;
}
```

The rearrangement is compiler dependent. In modern times, we do not worry about memory. 

## Avoid Padding
```c
#pragma pack (1) //one byte
#pragma pack (2) //one byte
#pragma pack (4) //one byte
#pragma pack (8) //one byte
```
Changes the *default* container size from `4` to whatever you define.

Note: `#pragma` is not always possible. Many compilers ignore this command.
