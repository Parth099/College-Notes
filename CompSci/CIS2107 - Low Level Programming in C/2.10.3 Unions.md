# C `union`s
## Motivation
A `union` is the same as a `struct`. It holds a collection of different datatypes. Their difference is how they allocate data.

We can only access **one** `union` element at a time, yet a `struct` can access any data-value at **any** time. This is because a `union` allocates one common storage space for all its *member*. While the the `sizeof` a struct is the sum of the elements. However the `sizeof` a union is the largest memory taking member.

## Syntax
```c
union student{
	int mark;
	char name[10]; //size of union student is 10
	float average;
}

int main(){
	union student report = {100, "Mani", 99.5};
	union student *rep = &report;	
	
}

/*
	[ACCESS]
	report.mark;
	report.name;
	report.average;
	
	//pointer access
	rep->name; 
*/
```

## Memory Representation
```c
union student
{
	char name[20];
	char subject[20];
	float percent;
}

int main(){
	union student record1;
	
	strcpy(record.name, "NAV"); //1
	strcpy(record.subject, "Math"); //2
	record.percent = 89; //3
	
	printf("%s\n", record.name);    //?
	printf("%s\n", record.subject); //?
	printf("%s\n", record.percent); //89
	
}
```

Now we only have `20 bytes` space on `record1`. What happens here is that each write to record indicated by `//number` overwrites the previous write.

Only the last write is saved to state. This is why we can only access one element at a time. The point of `union` is to save memory. It gives a slate where we can save our various datatypes while also preserving memory. Thus, a `struct` has **more** memory consumption.  

## Whats the need of `union`s
Unions are great for embedded systems. 
Example:
```c
struct connection
{	
	int type;
	union
	{
		struct Network network;
		struct USB usb;
		struct Virtual virtualConn;
	}
}

//as we can only have one active connection at a time. 
```
