# `typedef`
<!-- this is a prereq for 2.14 --> 
This gives an `alias` for datatypes.
It is simply syntactic sugar, for program readability.

You attach a name to a set of related datatypes and then ref the `typedef` alias to refer back when you need the datatype. `typedef.h` is a header file for useful type definition.

## Examples
### Basic
```c
typedef long long int LLI;

int main(){
	printf("Storage for LLI is: %ld", sizeof(LLI));//8
}
```
### Structs
```c
//old way
struct student record;
struct student *rep;
```

```c
//new way
typedef struct student status;

//declaration
status record;
status *rep;
```
