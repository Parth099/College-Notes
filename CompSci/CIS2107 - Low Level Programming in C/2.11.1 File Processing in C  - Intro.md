# File Processing !
Prereq: [[2.10.4 typedef]]

## Files in C
A file defined in C is just a number of `bytes` terminated by a EOF marker. 

Note: `FILE` is a type definition

## Opening a file
The code below is just a sample not meant to be run
```c
int main(){
	FILE *cfPpr; //cfPtr = clients.txt
	
	//Modes: 
	/*
		"w": write, 
		"a": append, 
		"r": read
	*/
	if((cfPtr = fopen("clients.txt", "w") == NULL)){
		puts("File NOT found");
	}
	else{
		//prints to explain how program works
		unsigned int account;
		char name[30];
		double balance;
		
		//scanf them in
		while(!feof(stdin)){
			fprintf(cfPtr, "%d %s %.2f\n", account, name, balance);
			
			//more code to scan and read data
		}
		fclose(cfPtr);
		
	}
	
}
```
**Note**: FILE is a typedef

Observations:
1. `feof(stdin)`: `int feof(FILE *stream)`. Returns 0 if non-`EOF` is detected
2. `fprintf` - writes to a file when a file pointer is present. It takes in a format spec and writes it based on that.
3. `fclose` to put the file out of memory.
4. `clients.txt` is a `.txt` | `.txt` is sequential
5. `fopen` rtype is a pointer. If it is `NULL` we didn't find a file. 
6. `stdin` is the *standard* input **stream**

The `.txt` file is sequential. The data is back to back.  

## File Mode Table
| Mode | Description                                                 |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| r    | open for reading                                            |
| w    | open for writing, if exists the current data is **deleted** |
| a    | append to file                                              |
| r+   | open for reading and writing                                |
| w+   | same as r+ but deletes any existing data                    |
| a+   | read but write to the end of the file (append)              |

Each mode has a binary mode. For example `rb+` opens a file in read-binary mode with writing enabled. 


## Class EXT
1. When a file is deleted is it not *actually* deleted yet we cannot see it. What actually occurs? 
2. Diff between stream vs file
