# Random Access Files: RAF
The issue with Sequential Files is that there many be empty areas. While Sequential Files are easy to create and write to, they are hard to trace. 

The data entries in RAFs are of a **fixed length**. Thus, we can access an entry directly rather than check each element before it.
> **Hint:** if all elements are of the same size we know its memory size and we can calculate its memory *location*. This is why we refer back to `struct`s. All we need is the *relative* location of file-item-1. 

How it looks in memory if each block was `100` bytes.

## Design of a RAF file
We will design a bank database.
In RAF files there must be one **unique** field.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

//size of CLIENTDATA - 37 
struct clientData{
	unsigned int acctNum; //4
	char lastname[15];
	char firstname[10];
	double balance; //8
};

int main(void){
	FILE *cfPtr;
	
	if((cfPtr = fopen("accounts.dat", "wb")) == NULL){
		puts("FILE DOES NOT EXIST");
		return -1; //EXIT program
	}
	struct clientData bankClient = {0, "", "", 0.0};
	
	for(size_t i = 1; i <= 100; i++){
		fwrite(&bankClient, sizeof(struct clientData), 1, cfPtr);
	}
	  
	fclose(cfPtr);   
	
}
```

Descrips: `fwrite` 
```c
//pusedo code
fwrite(&data, size of Data, how many data, file ptr);
```
We wrote 100 clients to the `.dat` RAF file where each entry is `37 bytes`. We can think of this as an `excel` file. However in reality they are not row-wise they are back to back sequentially. 

```c
INDEX : |       0 |       1 | ... |     N-1 |
STRUCT: | ENTRY 1 | ENTRY 2 | ... | ENTRY N |
SIZE  : | k bytes | k bytes | ... | k bytes |
```
At this point we have created an empty `RAF` file.
## Writing to RAF Files
```c
#include <stdio.h>

//size of CLIENTDATA - 37 
struct clientData{
	unsigned int acctNum; //4
	char lastname[15];
	char firstname[10];
	double balance; //8
};

int main(void){
	FILE *cfPtr;
	
	//from the last snippet this file WILL exist
	if((cfPtr = fopen("accounts.dat", "wb")) == NULL){
		puts("FILE DOES NOT EXIST");
		return -1; //EXIT program
	}
	struct clientData client = {0, "", "", 0};
	printf("%s", "Enter Account Number"
		 " (1 to 100, 0 end program): ");
	
	scanf("%d", &client.acctNum);
	while(client.acctNum != 0){
		printf("%s", "\nEnter Lastname, FirstName, balance: ");
		fscanf(stdin, "%14s%9s%lf", client.lastname, client.firstname, &client.balance);
		
		fseek(cfPtr, (client.acctNum) - 1 * sizeof(struct clientData), SEEK_SET);
		fwrite(&client, sizeof(struct clientData), 1, cfPtr);
		
		printf("%s", "Enter Account Number" " (1 to 100, 0 end program): ");
        scanf("%d", &client.acctNum);
	}
	
	fclose(cfPtr);
}
```

1. `fseek` does what it says it does. It finds the destination block to write to. `SEEK_SET` just tells it to count memory blocks from the start. There exists also `SEEK_CUR` and `SEEK_END`.


## Reading RAF Files
```c
//puesdo code
while(!feof(cfPtr)){
	struct clientData client = {0, "", "", 0.0};
	int result = fread(&client, sizeof(struct client), 1, cfPtr);
	//display code based on your data
}

//fclose
```

+ `fread` will read data into the struct pointer `1` element at a time as we specified as the *3rd* param. 
+ Output of `fread`: it returns the number of objects read. `0` signals EOF or an Error.

## Secure File Processing
We have been using `fprintf` and `fscanf` to write and read. 

We also have `fprintf_s` and `fscanf_s` which are **secure** versions of previous functions. 

While we don't in class. We should be checking the return values of each of the file functions r-value.
