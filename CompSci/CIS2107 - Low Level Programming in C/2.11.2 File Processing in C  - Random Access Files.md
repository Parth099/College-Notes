# Random Access Files: RAF
The issue with Sequential Files is that there many be empty areas. While Sequential Files are easy to create and write to, they are hard to trace. 

The data entries in RAFs are of a **fixed length**. Thus, we can access an entry directly rather than check each element before it.
> **Hint:** if all elements are of the same size we know its memory size and we can calculate its memory *location*. This is why we refer back to `struct`s. All we need is the *relative* location of file-item-1. 

How it looks in memory if each block was `100` bytes.

## Design of a RAF file
We will design a bank database.
In RAF files there must be one **unique** field.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

//size of CLIENTDATA - 37 
struct clientData{
	unsigned int acctNum; //4
	char lastName[15];
	char firstname[10];
	double balance; //8
};

int main(void){
	FILE *cfPtr;
	
	if((cfPtr = fopen("accounts.dat", "wb") == NULL)){
		puts("FILE DOES NOT EXIST");
		return -1; //EXIT program
	}
	struct clientData bankClient = {0, "", "", 0.0};
	
	for(size_t i = 1; i <= 100; i++){
		fwrite(&bankClient, sizeof(struct clientData), 1, cfPtr);
	}
	  
	fclose(cfPtr);   
	
}
```

Descrips: `fwrite` 
```c
//pusedo code
fwrite(&data, size of Data, how many data, file ptr);
```
We wrote 100 clients to the `.dat` RAF file where each entry is `37 bytes`. We can think of this as an `excel` file. However in reality they are not row-wise they are back to back sequentially. 

```c
INDEX : |       0 |       1 | ... |     N-1 |
STRUCT: | ENTRY 1 | ENTRY 2 | ... | ENTRY N |
SIZE  : | k bytes | k bytes | ... | k bytes |
```

## Reading and Writing to RAF Files
```c
#include <stdio.h>

//size of CLIENTDATA - 37 
struct clientData{
	unsigned int acctNum; //4
	char lastName[15];
	char firstname[10];
	double balance; //8
};

int main(void){
	FILE *cfPtr;
	
	if((cfPtr = fopen("accounts.dat", "rb+") == NULL)){
		puts("FILE DOES NOT EXIST");
		return -1; //EXIT program
	}
	
}
```
