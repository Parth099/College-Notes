# Memory Allocation
This note covers how to **dynamically** request memory while the program is **running**. 

## 4 main functions
| function  | What it is                  |
| --------- | --------------------------- |
| `malloc`  | memory alloc                |
| `calloc`  | clear alloc                 |
| `realloc` | reallocate                  |
| `free`    | free used memory back to OS |
|           |                             |

> **Note**: Each of these have a return value of a valid pointer location or *NULL* which signifies no space left. 

> **Note**: Each request for memory is given by the *heap*. This means each memory location from the functions above is from the *heap*.  

> **Note**: Notice that each memory altering function returns `void *`. We *must* cast to use use the space. 

### `malloc`
```c
#include <stdlib.h>
//...
void* malloc(size_t size); //syntax
```

This syntax gives us the pointer to a block in memory that can hold `number` integers (`4 bytes`). 
> **Important**: malloc spaces contain garbage values. If no space is viable, it will return *NULL*, we should always check for this issue.  

Now, `malloc` *has* a limit. If we keep requesting memory, there will soon be non left to serve. 

Example of requesting an `int` array.
```c
int* array = (int*)malloc(n * size(int));
```

### `calloc`
```c
void* calloc(number, sizeof(int))
```

This is similar to `malloc`. However, `calloc` is more secure because it will initialize each memory block with `0`, **unlike** `malloc`.   

### `realloc`
```c
void* realloc(pointer_name, number * sizeof(int))
```
`realloc` will reallocate space. This means that the pointer we specify to will be resized. (Not the literal pointer but the space it points to). It will **modify** the existing space. This can mean larger or smaller resizing. 

**Important** - must be previously allocated by `malloc`, `calloc` or `realloc`

### `free`
```c
free(pointer_name)
```
This will release the allocated space back to the operating system.

## Code Snippets
### `malloc` Example
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    char *mem_alloc;
    //dynamic alloc
    mem_alloc = malloc(20 * sizeof(char));
	printf("Memory Location: %p\n", mem_alloc);
    if(mem_alloc == NULL){
        return 1;
    }
	//copies 
    strcpy(mem_alloc, "I LOVE MALLOC");
    printf("Memory Content: %s\n", mem_alloc);
	//we free the memory 
	free(mem_alloc); //dangling pointer
	
	//dangling pointer: 
	//the pointer can go anywhere in memory
	
	//the fix:
	mem_alloc = NULL;
}
```
It is important to know that the `20 bytes` starting at `mem_alloc` **MAY** contain garbage values. 

Notice that `free` *will* free the memory **but**, the data you written there is **still** here and can be read again. 

This example would work the same if we used `calloc`, but we would not worry about garbage values since each value would be set to 0.

### `realloc` Example
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    char *mem_alloc;
    mem_alloc = malloc(20 * sizeof(char));
    printf("Memory Location: %p\n", mem_alloc);
    if(mem_alloc == NULL){
        return 1;
    }

    strcpy(mem_alloc, "I LOVE MALLOC");
    printf("Memory Content: %s\n\n", mem_alloc);

	//mem extension
    mem_alloc = realloc(mem_alloc, 100 * sizeof(char));
    printf("Memory Location: %p\n", mem_alloc);

    if(mem_alloc == NULL){
        return 1;
    }

    strcpy(mem_alloc, "I LOVE MALLOC but now I am using realloc to extend my space");
    printf("Memory Content: %s\n", mem_alloc);

    free(mem_alloc);
    mem_alloc = NULL;
}
```

It is important to know that, sometimes the pointer to the space stays the same. This means the extension of space is at the same place and we **do not** have to move our items to a new location.

*However*, sometimes we cannot find the additional space required in the same spot in memory we are in. Then, we **must** move our data to a space that allows for more space. If this occurs, the old block is *freed*.

> **Important**: We *cannot* assume that just because we are moving to a smaller space our data will not be moved.
