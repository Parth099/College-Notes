# Memory Management
## 4 main Regions of Memory
They are
+ `BSS/DATA`
+ `data`
+ `stack`
+ `heap`

> **Note**:  When we reference main memory we mean *ram* while other locations are *secondary*

These 4 main regions are on the **RAM**

### `BSS/DATA`
This is for `static` variables. This can also be global variable. Uninitialized variables are in the `bss` and set to `0`. The `static` values are stored in the `DATA` section.

### `stack`
This area of the memory is for functional scopes. Each time a function is called a `stack frame` is created to store these variables. When the function terminated the frame is popped and space is freed. 

### `heap`
The `heap` is a large region in memory to store large blocks of data. This is where the requested memory comes from. 
> **Note**: Any requested memory must be freed after use. 

## Example of Memory Leakage
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

struct leak{
    int x;
    char *str;
};


int main(){
    struct leak *memLeak = malloc(sizeof(struct leak));
    memLeak->x = 5;
    memLeak->str = malloc(6 * sizeof(char));

    strcpy(memLeak->str, "Hello");

    printf("x:%d\nstr:%s", memLeak->x, memLeak->str);
    
    //x:5
    //str: hello

    free(memLeak);
    memLeak = NULL;
}
```
The issue is that we did not free the `str`.
