# Dangling, Void, and Wild Pointers
## Deallocation
```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
	int *ptr = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int));
	free(ptr);
	ptr = NULL;
}
```

With out the `NULL` assignment `ptr` is still a **valid** pointer in memory that can access anything. 

## Functional Call
```c
#include<stdio.h>

int* fun(){
	int x = 19;
	return &x;
}

int main(){
	int *p = fun();
	printf("%d", *p);
	
	return 0;
}
```
Given that `x` lives on the stack, it will go **out of scope** once `fun` is terminated. Thus, the address provided is **invalid/garbage** data. The fix for this is to make `x` a `static` variable. 
```c
int* fun(){
	static int x = 19;
	return &x;
}
```
Now  `&x` is a valid address even after `fun` is terminated (`x` is no longer on `stack` but on `BSS/DATA`). 

## Out of Scope Example
```c
void main(){
	int* ptr = NULL;
	{
		//code ...
		int ch = 10;
		ptr = &ch;
	}
	
	/*
		at this point ptr is a dangling pointer
		this is because the code in the {...} is freed
		ptr is trying to access unauthorized data
	*/
	printf("Value = %d", *ptr);
}
```

## Wild Pointer
```c
int main()
{
	int* p;
	int x = 10;
	
	//at this point p is wild
	
	p = &x;
	//not anymore
}
```
