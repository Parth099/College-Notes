# Function Pointers
I was having trouble 2.14.1 so I made this

src: [SOF](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/840501/how-do-function-pointers-in-c-work)

## The Example
```c
int addInt(int n, int m) {
    return n+m;
}
```

Now to declare the pointer to this function:
```c
int (*functionPtr)(int,int) = &addInt;
```

Here is it running properly
```c
int main(void)
{
    int (*functionPtr)(int,int) = &addInt;
    printf("%d", functionPtr(1,1));
    return 0;
}
```
