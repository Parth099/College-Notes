I don't plan to cover basics that also appear in other languages like `for-loop` or `switch-case`. 

## The `main` Method
The `main` is the entry of the program. 
```C
int main(int argc, char *agrv[]){
	//code
	printf("Welcome to C\n");
}
```
`printf` is from the `stdio.h` file the *f* stands for format.

Note: This is just one of many `main` signatures.
It is the same as the standard 
```c
int main(){
	int i;
	scanf("%d", &i);
	//main will return 0 by default, no need to declare it 
	//return of a non-0 implies an error in runtime. 
}
```
While the OS manages memory internally, the compiler will place the data you need in the correct addresses.

### Bonus
What is the difference between a function in C vs Method in Java.
See how `printf` is a variadic function.
