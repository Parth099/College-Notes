Notes on *basic* elements of code will **not** be stored here.  

## The Address operator `&` and `scanf`
In C, the parameters are passed by value and not my memory address. The only way to pass by reference is to pass in the pointer to the variable. 

An example of this is the `scanf` function. It reads the `STDIN` and inputs the value of it into the var you pass in. Since we want the value to be stored in our variable, we pass it in with an `&` to send in the memory address.
```c
//scan for a double and store it
double value;
scanf("%lf", &value);
```

### `scanf` functional detail
`scanf` can take many positional args like:
```c
int num1, num2;
scanf("%d %d", &num1, &num2);
```
That is the format it will try to match. 

## Type Casting
```c
//int -> float
float average;  //total & counter are both int
average = ( float ) total / counter;
```

## Operator Precedence
![[op_preced_2.png]]
`?:` is the Ternary Operator.
```c
(bool) ? f(): g(); 
```
## Scope
The scope determines the visibility of a variable. The scope/visibility is enclosed by the closest pair of `{}` to the variable.

```c
int main( void ){
	double p = 17;
	for(unsigned int i = 0; i < 100; i++){
		//code...
	}
}
```
The `int` $i$ can only be used by the for loop here while $p$ can be used by the entire main, i.e global scope.

## Functions


### Class EXT
+ Sentinel Value: A `value` that ends the loop.
+ `unsigned int` datatype: The value must be greater than zero. The print flag is `%u`.
+ Short hand notation like `+=` saves the CPU read/write cycles.
+ Learn `getChar()`
+ Explain Ascii vs UTF, which one is a superset and translates.
+ `EOF` : "End of File" and is a var equal to`-1`. It is in all caps because that is the stylistic choice for `final` or `const` variables. It is contained in the `<stdio.h>`.
+ `%c` $\to$ char, `%d` $\to$ int
### Class Ext - Q $\to$ A
- `getChar()`: returns a character (an `unsigned char`) from `STDIN`. The value returned is of type `int`.
