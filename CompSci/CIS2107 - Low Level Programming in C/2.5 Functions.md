# Functions in **C**
The goal of functions is to decouple the `main` function. Functions also make the code more developer friendly. 

## Function Prototype
In C there exists something known as a `Function Prototype`. 
Imagine we have a `square` function. 
```c
int square(int y){
	return y * y;
} 
```
we must have the prototype at the top as 
```c
int square(int y);

```
We need to inform the compiler of the functions that exist below the main. This is also know as a function signature.
