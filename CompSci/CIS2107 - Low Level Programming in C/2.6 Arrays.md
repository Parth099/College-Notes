# Arrays in C
Along with the parenthesis the `[]` for index calculation is at the highest precedence in C.

## Creating an Array
The array is an standard datatype nothing to import.

```c
#define SIZE 5
//prepressor replaces all vars with their value
//it will put 5 where ever it sees `SIZE`
int main(void){
	int n[SIZE]; //5 elements of int
	
	for(size_t i = 0; i < 5; ++i){
		n[i] = 0; 
		//set each element to 0 since they arent always 0
	}
}
```

We can also use an Initializer list:
```c
int L[5] = {1, 4, 9, 16, 25};
int M[7] = {0}; //{0,0,0,0,0,0,0}
```
`size_t` is just `unsigned int` it makes code easier to write. It is a `typedef`. 

In array `L`, if we know that $1$ is in `byte` location 32, then $4$ is in `byte` location 36, since integers are 4 bytes long.

## Char Arrays $\to$ Strings
The size of a `char` is **1** byte. 

An array if `char`s is a `string`. This array **must** be terminated by `null` character **`\0`**. We would not print out the `\0`. 

When we calculate the size of a `string`, we *don't* include the `\0`. Size as in `memory` size.
