# Pointers
A pointer provides indirect control over a variable. 
Pointers allow us to work with *raw* memory locations. This was useful when systems had less total memory space but isn't the most useful now. 

They allow a program to utilize less memory and run faster. 

## Usage
Pointers are used in 3 **key** ways
1. simulate pass-by-reference 
2. pass functions between functions
3. creating dynamic data structures

This is why we use pointers above arrays. Creation Arrays require future knowledge about size. With pointers they can be allocated memory from the heap over runtime.

## Code
```c
int main(void)
{
	int a = 7;
	int *aPtr = &a; //pointer to a 
	printf("Address: %p\nValue: %d", aPtr, a);
	//aPtr is the same as &a
	
	//Pointers also have a pointer. 
	printf("Pointer Addess: %p", &aPtr);
}
```
```out
[OUTPUT]
Address: 0000007b433ff7dc
Value: 7
Pointer Addess: 0000007b433ff7d0
```
See that `int *aPtr` is a datatype that describes a pointer to an integer. 
1. `&` reference operator
2. `*` de-reference operator

## Pointer Tips
+ Never allow pointers to be un-initialized
	+ They can be initialized to `NULL`, 0, or an address
	+ A pointer to `NULL` points to *nothing*
	+ `NULL` is a symbolic constant defined in the `stddef.h` and several other header files.
	+ Assigning to 0 is the same as `NULL` but `NULL` is preferred for readability
## Pointers and Strings
A `char *` is really a String. 
```c
char c = 'A';
char *cptr;
cptr = &c;
```
## `Null` vs `void *`
