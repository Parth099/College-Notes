# Pointers
A pointer provides indirect control over a variable. 
Pointers allow us to work with *raw* memory locations. This was useful when systems had less total memory space but isn't the most useful now. 

They allow a program to utilize less memory and run faster. 

## Usage
Pointers are used in 3 **key** ways
1. simulate pass-by-reference 
2. pass functions between functions
3. creating dynamic data structures

This is why we use pointers above arrays. Creation Arrays require future knowledge about size. With pointers they can be allocated memory from the heap over runtime.

## Code
```c
int main(void)
{
	int a = 7;
	int *aPtr = &a; //pointer to a 
	printf("Address: %p\nValue: %d", aPtr, a);
	//aPtr is the same as &a
	
	//Pointers also have a pointer. 
	printf("Pointer Addess: %p", &aPtr);
}
```
```out
[OUTPUT]
Address: 0000007b433ff7dc
Value: 7
Pointer Addess: 0000007b433ff7d0
```
See that `int *aPtr` is a datatype that describes a pointer to an integer. 
1. `&` reference operator
2. `*` de-reference operator

They both run right to left.
```c
int p = &b;
```

## Pointer Reqs.
+ Never allow pointers to be un-initialized
	+ They can be initialized to `NULL`, 0, or an address
	+ A pointer to `NULL` points to *nothing*
	+ `NULL` is a symbolic constant defined in the `stddef.h` and several other header files.
	+ Assigning to 0 is the same as `NULL` but `NULL` is preferred for readability
## Pointers and Strings
A `char *` is really a String. 
```c
char c = 'A';
char *cptr;
cptr = &c;
```
## Pointer Example
![[mem-infogph.png]]
```c
int main(){
	//make it point to null for system safty
	int *ptr = NULL; //declare ptr to int type 
	int a, b;
	
	a = 12;
	ptr = &a; //set pointer value to a's address
	//use * to pull the value out of 0x0A: a's address
	b = *(ptr);
}
```
A pointer with no value is called "dangling pointer". 
## Pointer Size
A pointer to `float` is the same size as an `int`. A pointer just holds an memory address and thus should be the same WRT the machine.
+ 32 bit machine - 4 bytes
+ 64 bit machine - 8 bytes

## Pointer Functional implementations
```c
void cubeByReference(int *nPtr); //proto

int main()
{
	int n = 5;
	printf("%d", cubeByReference(&n));
}
//modifies the actual number n from main.
void cubeByReference(int *nPtr)
{
	*nPtr = *nPtr * *nPtr * *nPtr;
}
```

## `Null` vs `void *`
A `void*` has a pointer without a type.

## Using the `const` Qualifier with Pointers
### 4 ways to pass points
1. `non-constant` pointer to `non-constant` data
2. `const` pointer to `non-constant` data. 
	-	We can only use the pointer we cannot move the pointer to another location
3. `non-constant` pointer to `const` data
4. `const` pointer to `const` data

Each of the four combos provides different access privs.
### Examples
#### A
```c
//void convertToUpperCase(char *sPtr);
void convertToUpperCase(char *sPtr)
{
	while(*sPtr != '\0'){
		*sPtr = toupper(*sPtr); //works on single chars
		++sPtr; 
	//moves pointer to next memory cell via pointer arith
	}
}
```
This function will convert all *valid* chars to uppercase.
`toupper(char* c)` is from `<ctype.h>`:
> header file of the C Standard Library declares several functions that are useful for testing and mapping characters
```c
int main(void)
{
	char string[] = "cHaRaCters and $32.98";
	printf("\nBefore :%s", string); 
	//"cHaRaCters and $32.98"
	convertToUpperCase(string);
	printf("\nAfter :%s", string);
	//"CHARACTERS AND $32.98"
}

```
The data is ***permanently*** changed now.
#### B.1
```c
//notice how the char pointer is now constant
void printCharacters(const char *sPtr)
{
	for(; *sPtr != '\0'; sPtr++){
		printf("%c", *sPtr);
	}	
}

int main(void)
{
	char string[] = "print characters of a string";
	
	puts("The string was:");
	printCharacters(string);
}
```

The pointer `const char *sPtr` means `sPtr` is **read-only**. It cannot modify the character it points at. 

#### B.2
```c
void f(const int *xPtr)
{
	*xPtr = 5; //error: attemp to modify const dt
	//error C2166 - 
	//l-value specifies const object
}

int main(void)
{
	int y;
	f(&y); //error
	//f attemps ILLEGAL modification
}
```
#### C
```c
int main(void){
	
	//define
	int x, y; //int default to 0
	
	/*
	ptr is a constant pointer to an int but it can 
	now be changed. But we cannot move the pointer
	to a new memory address.
	*/
	int * const ptr = &x;
	
	*ptr = 17; //valid, *ptr is NOT constant
	ptr = &y; 
	//error ptr IS constant 
	// => cannot assign new address
	
	//error C2166 - l-value specifies const object
}
```

Read pointer declaration from right to left. This way we note that the **pointer is constant** and not the data. In Examples **B.1-2**, the data was constant and not the actual pointer. In **C**, the pointer was `const`: not assignable.

In short, we need to check what is actually constant, the pointer or the data type. 
We check right to left. If the `const` is to the right of the datatype then the pointer is *constant*. Otherwise the data the pointer is pointing to is labeled `cosnt`.

> **Important**
> While casting of pointers exists, we must match datatype and pointer. 

#### D
```c
int main(){
	int x = 5;
	int y;
	
	const int * const ptr = &x;
	
	*ptr = 7; //error: data is const
	ptr = &y; //error: pointer is const
	
	//l-value error two times
}
```

#### Summary Table
| datatype / Pointer | regular                           | `const`                 |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| regular            | pointer can move and edit data    | pointer cannot be moved |
| `const`            | pointer can not move but can edit | pointer cannot move or edit                        |

## `sizeof` Operator
Applying `sizeof` to attain the size of the array.
```c
#define SIZE 20

size_t getSize(float *ptr);

int main(void){
	float array[SIZE];
	printf("Num bytes of array is %u"
		   "\nNum bytes returned by our getSize is %u", 
		  sizeof(array), getSize(array));
}

size_t getSize(float *ptr){
	return sizeof(ptr);
}
```

The outputted numbers are
```c
80 //sizeof(array)
4  //getSize(array)
```

`getSize(array)` is different because because it is actually getting the size of the pointer. See that it is `4` bytes, representative of a 32-bit system. We only passed the location of the array via `ptr` and then `sizeof` got the size of the pointer. 

`sizeof` examples
```c
char c;
int i;
int * ptr = &i;
prinf("sizeof c %u \tsizeof(char)\n"
	  "sizeof i %u \tsizeof(char)\n"
	  "sizeof ptr %u\n",
	  sizeof c, sizeof(char),
	  sizeof i, sizeof(int),
	  sizeof(ptr)
	 );
```
We can alter the sizes of data-types but we **cannot** change the size of a pointer ever. 

## Pointer Movement
Recall that a pointer to an array starts at the first index (`0`).

Here is an example for an `int v[]`, each `int` is `4 bytes`.
![[int_arr_ptr_rep.png]]

### Basic Movement
```c
for (size_t i = 0; i < SIZE; i++){
	print("v[%u] = %d\n", i, v[i]);
}
```
This was already known. 
### Pointer Offset Notation
```c
for (size_t i = 0; i < SIZE; i++){
	print("*(v + %u) = %d\n", i, *(v+i));
}
```
In the code block we can use `v` or `vptr` to access each element. 

This works because `ptr++` moves the pointer to the next block **not byte, block**. The size of this jump *depends* on the datatype. 

Thus, `ptr + k` moves the pointer forward `k` blocks. 
`ptr += 2` moves pointer forward two blocks and sets that to the value of the pointer. 

`ptr -= k` will move back `k` blocks and then set that address to the value of the pointer. 

For readability, we can even use pointer index notation
```c
Suppose the following declarations
int b[SIZE] = {10, 20, 30, 40}; 
int *bPtr = b;
Then: //mathematical equality not code
	b[2] = *(b + 2) = *(bPtr + 2) = bPtr[2] = 30;
```

Note we read expressions like:
```c
*(ptr + k)
```
from right to left. (**RTL**)

## Arrays \& Pointers
Sending in the Array Name is the same as sending in the pointer to the same location. 
### Copying String
We are copying `s2` into `s1` .
#### Method 1: Array Notation
```c
void copyStr1(char * const s1, const char * const s2){
	for(size_t i = 0; (s1[i] = s2[i] != '\0'; i++)){
		;
	}
}
```
> **Note**: We can allow for `const char * const s2` since we will be using pointer arithmetic. Since `s2[i] = *(s2+i)` . In other words the pointers for `s1, s2`  *do not* move. 

#### Method 2: Pointer Notation
```c
void copyStr2(char * s1, const char * s2){
	for(; (*s1 = *s2) != '\0'; s1++, s2++)){
		; //see that s1++ is the same as s1 = s1 + 1
	}
}
```
Now notice how none of the pointers are constant, since we need to be able to move them around. 

## Array of Pointer: The pointer Array
A common use of the pointer array is an array of strings. What this means is that each slot in the array holds a pointer to a different array (`2d-array`). 

```c
const char *suit[4] = {"Hearts", "Diamonds", "Clubs", "Spades"};
```

### Pointer Array of `Functions`
This helps us pass functions to other functions.
```c
//proto
void function1(int a);
void function2(int b);
void function3(int c);

int main(){
	
	void (*f[3])(int) = {function1, function2, function3};
	//functions names are not strings
}
```

Rule for the Pointer Array of Functions:
+ Each prototype is the same (`rtype`, `args`)

How `void (*f[3])(int)` works:
+ Step 1: Create an array of 3 -> `f[3]`
+ Step 2: What type? Pointer -> `*f[3]`
+ Step 3: Apply Parenthesis -> `(*f(3))`
+ Step 4: Pre-pend rtype -> `void (*f(3))`
+ Step 5: Append params -> ` void (*f(3))(int)` 

## Class Ext
How can we find the size of a function?
