## C Compilation Process
> by *readable*, we mean can we recognize what words are being used. 

![[steps_in_comp.png]]
See that `welcome.c` is readable (obviously). Then the program is modified with **your** preprocessor directives and then outputted with the `.i`  extension. Moreover, it is prepended with all the header files. Then it is compiled into byte-code and given the `.as` extension. It is being converted to assembly! Next is the `.o` file which is an object file. These are written in assembly language which are comprised of symbols and series of characters that are only understandable by the compiler. This is then given to the linker which will link together imports. The last part of this is the executable (also unreadable). 

+ For the test know each file in proper order and all components involved in each step.

## Commands
More information: [link](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.8.3/gcc/Overall-Options.html#Overall-Options)
### Preprocessor
```UNIX
gcc -E -o welcome.i welcome.c
```
The first part we need to understand here is that we are creating a new file(`welcome.i`) from an old one(`welcome.c`).

`-E` - stops the compilation procedure after preprocessing
`-o` - place the output file in `welcome.i`

### Compiling 
```UNIX
gcc -S -o welcome.s welcome.i
```
After preprocessing we compile this is evident since the input file to the compilation step is an `.i` file. 

`-S` - stop after the stage of compilation

### Assembly
```UNIX
gcc -c -o welcome.o welcome.s
```
`o` is **not** `.out`. The compiled code is then turned into assembly code.

### Linker
```UNIX
gcc -o welcome.o welcome
```
Link object modules of a program into a single object file. They also manage to link external modules. 

## Hardware
![[hardware_overview.png]]
Important Details for `2107`. 

+ Main Memory - RAM, see [[2.12.2 Memory Management in C]]
+ I/O Bridge - Connects RAM and CPU
+ ALU - Arithmetic Logic Unit
+ Registers - Closes and most expensive memory
+ PC - Program Counter, it has the address it the next instruction to be processed 

What is a BUS?
A bus is like a 'highway' a means of transportation for data, this is also the high-level definition [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_(computing)) provides. A memory bus can **only** be used my the RAM since we want RAM to be fast it has its own 'highway'.
