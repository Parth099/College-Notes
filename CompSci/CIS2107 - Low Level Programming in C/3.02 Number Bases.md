# Number Bases
Notes here will not be complete here. 

## Vocabulary 
+ bit: **b**inary dig**it**, it can be 0 or 1
+ 8 bits is a byte
+ 4 bits is a nibble
+ 2 bits is a half-nibble
+ binary: base 2 system
+ octal: base 8 
+ decimal: base 10
+ hex: base 16

Intel term sizes:

| word            | **byte** size |
| --------------- | ------------- |
| byte            | 1             |
| word            | 2             |
| doubleword      | 4             |
| quadword        | 8             |
| double quadword | 16              |

### Hex Addition Example
```JS
	   
   (1)(1)
	3  B  B  B  3
+	   E  8  1  4
-------------------
	4  A  3  C  7

```

### Hex Subtraction Example

## Programming
```c
int main(int argc, char **argv){
	
	int prod = 200*300*400*500;
	printf("prod = %d\n", prod); //-884901888
	
	prod = (200)*(300*400*500);
	printf("prod = %d\n", prod);
	
	prod = (200*300*400)*500;
	printf("prod = %d\n", prod);
	
	return 0;	
}
```
Any language where the `int` is 4 bytes will not be able to display this number. Java has this issue too. 

## XOR
```js
a XOR a = 0
a XOR b XOR b = a
```

**XOR Swap**
```c
void swap(int* a, int* b){
	*a ^= *b; //a = a XOR b
	*b ^= *a; //b = b XOR a
	*a ^= *b; //a = a XOR b
}
```

## Truth Value in C
`0x0` is false while any other value is `true`.
**Important**
`!` is the logical flip while `~` is the bit negation operator. They are not the same. 

## How numbers are stored
+ Big Endian
	+ most significant byte first
	+ Ex: SPARC, old Macs, Internet

+ Little Endian
	+ least significant byte first
	+ Ex: x86


> **Note**: significant corresponds to the literal value. In decimal format consider the number : 122345. The 5 is less significant than the 1 since the 1 stands in the 10^5 place.

### Example
```c
int i = 0x01234567; //hex value (split into groups of 2 bytes)
```
**Big Endian**
```c
Address| Value 
1001   | 01
1002   | 23
1003   | 45
1004   | 67
```

**Little Endian**
```c
Address| Value 
1001   | 67
1002   | 45
1003   | 23
1004   | 01
```

## Ext
1. Does there exist 128-bit OS?
	+	No there does not exist any 128-bit OS because they are not needed. The main reason for the shift for 64-bit CPUs was to have more then 4GB of memory. 64 bits gives you 16 exabytes of RAM. From: [Quora](https://www.quora.com/Why-arent-there-128-bit-CPUs)

2. Why is the bit number even?
	+	There is a lot of math that has been developed for power of two bit systems. Often times we take module operator, this has been optimized for PO2 bit systems. This also applies to +, and \*.
