# Assembly
This note is not about how to write Assembly. It serves to understand how *C* works. 

## Why not to use Assembly
1. Compilers are already good at what they do
2. tedious; easy to screw up
3. **not** portable. 

> **Notice** how these are the same flaws for *C*. 

## Assembly Example
![[assembly_lifecycle_C_ex.png]]

Anything with the `%` is a register name, while the `pushl, move, subl` are *instructions*.

+ Instruction Set:
	+ set of operations a processor supports. 
	+ They are usually primitive things, the collection of primitive operations are used to make larger programs. 
+ IA32 - the name of the instruction set
	+ Intel Architecture

## Registers
A register is the most important part of CPU memory. It can hold addresses or instructions. A register is the fastest piece of memory. Registers are not very large in memory.  A register can vary in Quantity and Quantity. Each register has a purpose which is what it is named after. While the computer does not care about register names, we should. 

A CPU will fetch an instruction from a register which has the address in memory (RAM). Then the CPU will read the data (decode) and lastly they will execute it. 

## Steps In Compilation 
Recall the steps in Compilation :
```c
file.c -> assembler -> linker -> binary output
```

Does there exists the reverse cycle in which we have:
```c
assembler -> file.c //?
```

We **can** disassemble any executable. This represents
```c
binary output -> assembler
```

## Bonus Questions
1. Does there exists a disassembler? 
	+	A disassembler transfers machine code into assembly language statements. However for this to work, it must target a specific architecture (CPU). IDA is a x86 windows disassembler that is said to be good at its job, but it comes with a heavy price tag. 

2. Does there exists a decompiler?
	+	A decompiler aims to take machine code and turn it into high level language code. This is sadly imperfect since each compiler produces different machine code. This a decompiler is compiler dependent. There are too many factors when decompiling. Thus the decompiler will almost never produce the same code used to create the machine code. There exists many decompilers, one of them is [Mocha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mocha_(decompiler)), it takes java bytecode and turns it into potential source code.
