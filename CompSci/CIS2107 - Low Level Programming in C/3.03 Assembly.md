# Assembly
This note is not about how to write Assembly. It serves to understand how *C* works. 

## Why not to use Assembly
1. Compilers are already good at what they do
2. tedious; easy to screw up
3. **not** portable. 

> **Notice** how these are the same flaws for *C*. 

## Assembly Example
![[assembly_lifecycle_C_ex.png]]

Anything with the `%` is a register name, while the `pushl, move, subl` are *instructions*.

+ Instruction Set:
	+ set of operations a processor supports. 
	+ They are usually primitive things, the collection of primitive operations are used to make larger programs. 
+ IA32 - the name of the instruction set
	+ Intel Architecture

## Registers
A register is the most important part of CPU memory. It can hold addresses or instructions. A register is the fastest piece of memory. Registers are not very large in memory.  A register can vary in Quantity and Quantity. Each register has a purpose which is what it is named after. While the computer does not care about register names, we should. 

A CPU will fetch an instruction from a register which has the address in memory (RAM). Then the CPU will read the data (decode) and lastly they will execute it. 

## Steps In Compilation 
Recall the steps in Compilation :
```c
file.c -> assembler -> linker -> binary output
```

Does there exists the reverse cycle in which we have:
```c
assembler -> file.c //?
```

We **can** disassemble any executable. This represents
```c
binary output -> assembler
```
