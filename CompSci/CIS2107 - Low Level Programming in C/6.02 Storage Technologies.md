# Memory Hierarchy
1. RAM - Main Memory
2. Disks - Secondary (optional) Memory

Internal Memory types. 

![[memory_types.png]]

ROM - Read only memory. This is where the BIOS is stored; the kernel is started from. 

## Random Access Memory

![[Ram_types.png]]

1. SRAM - *Static* RAM
2. DRAM - *Dynamic* RAM

### SRAM

1. Fast \& Expensive
2. Used for cache memory
	+	closest memory to the CPU
	+	thus the data in SRAM is latest (no refresh)
3. Few MB at best
4. More transistors / Circuits
5. Entries persist until no power (stable memory)

### DRAM
1. Used for *MAIN* memory
2. sensitive to disturbance (elec. noise, radiation)
	+	Stores each bit on a capacitor as a charge
3.	Leakage
	+	needs refreshed since it will lose data but its auto refreshed
4. Slower and cheaper than SRAM


### SRAM vs DRAM

## Storage Volatility
A Storage type is Volatile is values are lost when power is removed.

Examples of non-Volatile:
```
ROMs, PROMs, Firmware, SSD
```

## Disks
![[inside_HDD.png]]

The disks contain `1`s and `0`s. 

### Disk Geometry
Disks contain platters each with two surfaces (top \& bottom).
Each surface has tracks which has sectors separated by gaps. 

![[disk_geometry.png]]

A track can be known as a cylinder. 
This geometry serves as the navigational system.


### Disk Capacity Computation
![[disk_capacity_computation.png]]

Its easier to think about this if you start from the back of the equation. 

### Operations

![[disk_io.png]]

Recall that there exists many platters:

![[n_platters.png]]

Each platter contains its own arm. 

> The disks are spinning around to find data. The can spin 7200 RPM.

### IO BUS

![[bus_diagram_IO.png]]

See that the BUS for disks is not the same as memory since it is longer (2 diff connections) and has a controller. 

CPU triggers a `read` operation bu writing a command, logical block number, and destination memory address to a port (address) associated with disk controller.

The controller will read the block by performing a DMA (direct memory access) and transfer into main memory. The CPU will get to the memory accessed later from the main memory.

Once the retrieval is done (the file is put on memory) the controller will notify the CPU via an *clock interruption*. 

## SSDs

![[ssd_anot.png]]

There are no more layers (platters) everything is on the same layer. 

Pieces of memory are organized by blocks. Then blocks have pages. The data is read/written in terms of *pages*. 

> Note Read/Write OPs are not unlimited, a block will die after nearly 100,000 writes. 

Note that for an SSD there are no arms or moving parts in an SSD, thus it will survive longer than a HDD.

### SDD Performance
![[ssd_perf.png]]

Why is write *slower*?

Writing to an SSD is similar to in insertion to an array. We first must find a valid block to write to. Then we erase the old data in the block. Next, we also need to copy other blocks to different blocks to allocate proper space. 


## SSDs vs HDDs

1. SDD will live longer as stated above but know SSDs can still wear out. 
2. SSD memory is more expensive but lighter. 


## CPU-Memory Gap
![[cpu_mem_gap.png]]

Lesson: The storage techs are the bottleneck for the faster CPU.
We should care about this due to CPU utilization, the slower the storage types are the lower the CPU utilization; this is a waste of time/money.
