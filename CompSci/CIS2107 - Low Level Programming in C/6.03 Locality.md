# Locality and Memory Hierarchy 
![[nice_pyramid_mem_hire.png]]

The closer we get to the top the faster the memory is. 
The caches work in unison:

CPU registers will hold `words` retrieved from L1 which has retrieved from L2 which has retrieved from L3.

Now L3 has retrieved from main memory which has retrieved from secondary storage(s). 

### Cache Hierarchy

See that each core has its own components (registers, caches)
