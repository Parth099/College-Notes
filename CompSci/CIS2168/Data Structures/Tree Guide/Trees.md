# Trees
The Tree is a pointer based [[Data Structure]] in which nodes hold pointers to other nodes which also hold internal data. 

We will only examine trees in which a node has at most $m$ children. These trees are known as $m$-ary trees and our focus will be with trees that exist when $m = 2$, know as **Binary** Trees.

Here is the required Vocab.
