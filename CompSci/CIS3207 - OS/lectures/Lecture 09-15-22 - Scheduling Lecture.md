Questions addresses: 
1. What are the different CPU Scheduling schemes?
2. What type of workload works well with each CPU Scheduler algorithm?

## Dynamics of Process Activity
This is what we have been talking about for a while.

### Suspended Process
Suspended Process - **does not** compete for CPU time but is in memory or in swapping. 

Swapping:
1. Involves moving part or all of a process from main memory to disk
2. When no processes in main memory are in `Ready` state the OS will swap the blocked processes out on to disk and into a suspended queue. We swap processes on to a disk to allow for more memory (start new process) which can allow the CPU to be utilized.

When the event occurs that will **un**block a suspended process, it will be swapped back on.

## Two Components for Process Scheduling
1. Dispatcher
	+ Low Level mechanism
	+ Performs context-switch
		+ Switch to kernel mode
		+ save execution state to Process's PCB
		+ Insert old process's PCB into ready queue
		+ Load next process from its PCB
		+ Switch to user mode
2. Scheduler
	+ Process to determine which process gets CPU and when.

### Vocab
Workload - set of job descriptions (arrival time, runtime)
Job - View as current CPU burst of a process 
Scheduler - logic (policies) that decides which ready job to run
Metric - a measurement dimension of scheduling quality


### Metrics
1. Minimize Turnaround time
	+ Do not wait long for job to finish
	+ `Completion_time – arrival_time`
2. Minimize response time
	+ Schedule interactive jobs promptly so users see output quickly
	+ `Initial_schedule_time – arrival_time`
3. Minimize waiting time
	+ minimize waiting time in the *Ready*
4. Maximize throughput, resource utilization[^1], CPU fairness
5. Minimize Overhead (EX: context switching, ...)
