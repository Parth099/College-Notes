# Lecture 10 27 22
Recall our solution (Base and Limit registers) from last time to form an address space for **contiguous** programs. 

![addr_trans_concept](../../img/addr_trans_concept.png)

Memory Location: Moving the program around in memory. 

***Dynamic Linking***:
> Linking a code module is postponed until execution time

There is code that runs that locates these libraries and inserts them into code. This is called a *stub*, this stub it will be replaced by the address to the library routines. 

![lib_stub](../../img/lib_stub.png)

In statement "CRp is code RR", RR stands for replacement register. 

This way memory is saved by not loading **redundant** library routines many times. 

## Memory Fragmentation
Two kinds of Fragmentation
1. External Fragmentation
	+ regions of real memory that are outside of the space occupied/allocated to programs. The space not directly allocated to processes without â€˜compaction'
2. Internal Fragmentation
	+ allocated memory may be slightly larger than requested memory; this size difference is memory internal to a partition or allocation, but not being used

When you call `malloc(1)` it is unlikely you will get $1$ byte. You may get $4, 8$ or $16$ .

## External Fragmentation - External to the process
> total memory space exists to satisfy a request for memory, but it is not contiguous.

To reduce fragmentation we need to compact. 

![ext_frag](../../img/ext_frag.png)

Notice a program **cannot** be moved when it is doing IO. 

## Non-Contiguous Memory Allocation
Two ways to represent a memory cell
1. Direct Integer (left)
2. Binary Integer (right)

![mem_rep_bin_int](../../img/mem_rep_bin_int.png)


We can even partition the memory into blocks. 

![mem_rep_bin_int](../../img/mem_block.png)

The integers on the left are block numbers. 

### Paging
+ Process consists of fixed-size memory blocks called pages
	+ frame size is determined by hardware
	+ In the logical address space blocks are called pages whilst physical blocks are called frames. 
+ Page is a contiguous sequence of bytes
+ Eliminates external fragmentation

### Segmentation
+ Made up of blocks but are not of the same size
	+ Example: A heap, function, array, ... might have a block
+ Programmer identifies logical entities in a program; each is called a segment and is a contiguous set of bytes
+ Facilitates sharing of code, data, and program modules between processes

We can also utilize both at the same time. 

## Paging 
+ divides both the logical address space of a process and the physical memory (RAM) into equal size blocks

A page is a fixed-size contiguous block of a logical address space identified by a single number, the page number. A page-frame is a fixed-size contiguous block of physical memory identified by a single number: the page frame number.

A page frame is the smallest unit of data for memory management and may contain a copy of any page. 

A page table is an array that keeps track of which pages of a given logical address space reside in which page frames.
+ Each page table entry corresponds to one page and contains the starting address of the frame containing the page

We divide real memory into a number of equal-sized contiguous blocks or page **frames**. ( $f_0, f_1, \dotso, f_{n-1}$ ) 

The frames are usually sized in a power of $2.$

The logical space is is divided into equal-sized contiguous **pages** $p_0, p_1, \dotso, p_{n-1}$ ) . 

Recall what a logical address space is from [[Lecture 08-30-22 - Intro to Processes]]:

> Logical Space - The memory space the program is virtualized with. A process will think that this is the space it has

![how_to_addr_under_pagging](../../img/how_to_addr_under_pagging.png)

If a program is placed into 5 pages we can place them into any 5 frames. 

### Page table
> Each process has a page-table inside the PCB. 

![page_table](../../img/page_table.png)

### Summary
+ Divide physical memory into fixed-sized blocks called frames
	+ OS must keep track of all free frames
+ Divide logical memory into blocks of the same size, called pages
+ To run a program of size n pages, need to find n free frames and load program
+ Internal fragmentation, but minimal

### Address Translation Scheme
![page_offset](../../img/page_offset.png)

Notice the system knows how large a block is. This is how it knows how to subtract off the $n$ bits.  

![mmu_page](../../img/mmu_page.png)

### Example
![page_e1](../../img/page_e1.png)

### Page-table Management
We said the OS keeps track of the free frames but it also has a cleaning process as well. 

Page table is kept in main-memory.

Page table base register - points to the top of the page while a page-table length register indicates the size of the page table. 

In this translation scheme each instruction requires **2** memory accesses. One for the page table access and one for the data/instruction read/write. (**PROBLEM**)

This two time look up can be solved with caches. There exists a TCB (Transnational Look Aside buffer). 

The entries are:
```txt
ASID - PID
PAGE  #
FRAME #
```

Only *if* there is a TLB miss, we hit the two-time look up.
