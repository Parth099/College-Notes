# Lecture 11-10-22 Demand Paging and Swapping

> Read OSTEP 20-22

**Demand Paging**: [[Lecture 11-08-22 - Mem_Management Review]]

In short memory locations we do not call on are not loaded until we do. 

Demand Paging is a another advantage of paging. 

## Page Fault - Instruction Backup / restart

**Learn what a Page Fault is**: [[Lecture 11-08-22 - Mem_Management Review]]

> Following a Page Fault, Restarting an instruction requires hardware support since some memory areas or registers may have been changed prior to the page fault

### Faults

There can be many faults per instruction. When the first *invalid* address is seen a page fault occurs and that page is loaded. This instruction is repeated where another reference will cause a page fault causing its corresponding page to be loaded in.   

### Handling Page Faults

The OS **owns all frames** and it can allocate a frame for a requested page.  

### Choosing a Frames for Pages
If no frame is free there needs to be a page replacement operation. 

Using a page replacement algorithm we need to choose what page to replace. 

**DIRTY BIT** - A `isModified` bit. If you write into a page it becomes modified. Thus if we overwrite a modified page we have no memory of what we changed. 

However if a frame is not dirty it has not been changed since being loaded. Therefore if we replace a unmodified page we can bring it back by going to where we found it. 

## Performance
### Performance of Demand Paging
Memory access time: $.2$ micro-sec ( $m_a$ )
If there are no page faults we need $2x$ the time to get to the page (no TLB)
1. One access to the page table
2. One to find entry

If there is a fault we must bring a page into memory

$p_f$ - Probability of a page fault

EAT for demand paging:

$$
\text{EAT} = (1-p_f)*2*m_a + p_f(p_t + 2 * m_a)
$$

$p_t$ - time to service a page fault (see below)

![time_consume_page_fault](/img/time_consume_page_fault.png)

The process is blocked when a missing page is requested. 

***Summary of Operations***:
1. Service PF interrupt
2. Locate and Swap in the page
3. Restart the process that was blocked (*IO*)

The number of faults more so depends on the locality of the code.
