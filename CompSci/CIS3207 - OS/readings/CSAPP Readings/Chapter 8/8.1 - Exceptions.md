# Intro to CP8
- Control Flow
	- When the PC moves on to the next instruction
- Smooth Control Flow
	- When the next instruction is adjacent to the last one in memory
	- Not all flows on control are smooth

A system must be able to react to changes that are outside of the current running process like IO interrupts or packets arriving at the network adapter. These reactions will be **abrupt**, we refer to these abrupt changes as *exceptional control changes* (ECF). 

# 8.1 - Exceptions
Exceptions are partly implemented by the hardware and the OS, this implies that implementational vary per system. Here is a diagram about exceptions:

![exception_diag](/img/exception_diag.png)

When a exception occurs at the current instruction ($I_\text{curr}$) it must be handled. The processor detects an event has occurred and makes a procedure call. It knows which one to call via the *exception
table*.

Once it is handled the processor can do one of three things:
1. Continue $I_\text{curr}$
2. Start $I_\text{next}$
3. About the current process

## 8.1.1 Handling Exceptions
Each type of possible exception in a system is assigned a unique nonnegative integer exception number\*. Examples include:
+ div by 0
+ page faults
+ memory access violations
+ arithmetic overflow

The exception table is configured during boot time, then during runtime when an exception occurs, the appropriate code is *jumped to* and ran. 

\* - This number is an index for a jump table which points to the relevant exception handler code. This code runs in `kernel mode`, it has all permissions. 

Once relevant exception handler code runs, the OS resumes control to the running process by returns its state with a `return from interrupt` instruction.

## 8.1.2 Exceptions Classes
1. interrupts\*
2. traps
3. faults
4. aborts\*\*

\* - Only interrupts are async.
\*\* - **DO NOT** return do the next instruction.

### Interrupts
Interrupts occur async as a result of signals from IO devices that are **external** to the processor. Handlers for interrupts are known as interrupt handlers. Interrupts return to the next instruction when they are done being handled. The graphic is the same as the graphic in 8.1.

### Traps and System Calls
These are **intentional**, they are the result of executing an instruction. The most common use of traps stem from a procedure-like interface between user programs and the kernel (`syscalls`). A user program may need to read a file, create a process, or load other programs. The kernel provides control instruction via system calls. Executing `syscall` instructions causes a trap to an exception handler which will decode arguments and call the relevant kernel code. The graphic is the same as the graphic in 8.1.

> C programs can invoke any system call directly by using the syscall function. However this is **not** the standard since there are many libraries to complete usual tasks.

### Faults
Faults stem from error conditions that are possible for a *fault handler* **to correct**. If the error is able to be fixed control is resumed but if not, the error handler returns an about routine which *ends* the error-ing process.  

An example of a fault is the General protection fault (`segmentation
fault`)

### Aborts
- result from unrecoverable fatal errors
- usually hardware errors
- abort handlers end the process that caused the error
