# 8.3 syscall error Handling
When UNIX based systems encounter an error they usually return `-1` and set the global integer `errno`  to indicate what went wrong. 

We can use function wrappers to handle errors. The wrappers take the same arguments as the regular functions but they can manage the errors that stem from executing the function. 

# 8.4 Process Control
## Obtaining PID
```c
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>

//pid_t -> int
pid_t getpid(void); //get pid
pid_t getppid(void); //get parent paid
```

Each process has a non-zero PID. 

## Creating and Terminating Processes
A process can be in one of three (maybe more...) states. 
1. Running
2. Stopped
	+ The process is suspended and will **not** be scheduled until it received a `SIGCONT` signal.
	+ Note the process was stopped due to one of the signal:
		+ `SIGSTOP`, `SIGTSTP`, `SIGTTIN`, or `SIGTTOU`
3. Terminated
	+ Process that is stopped permanently
	+ It is stopped for the following reasons:
		+ Termination Signal
		+ returning from the `main`
		+ calling `exit` function
			+ `void exit(int status)`

### Parent and Child Processes
```c
pid_t fork(void); 
```

- Fork is covered in [[OSTEP - 5]]
- The **parent** and **child** run concurrently but are separate logically 

The child process has the same file descriptors open so it can read/write to any file the parent can and the address space up to the point of the `fork` is mapped similarly. If a variable `x` exists at address `x'` it will be the same for the child too. 

## Reaping Child Processes
When a process terminates for *any* reason the process is not removed immediately, the kernel waits for the parent process to *reap* the child process. When reaped the kernel will pass the exit status to the parent. Until reaped, a child process is in a zombie state if already terminated. 

If a parent process ends the `init` process (always running, initiated at boot, `pid: 1`) adopts any orphaned children and reaps them. A long running process like a shell should always reap processes as they waste system resources. 

A process can wait for its children or end then with the `waitpid` function.

```c
pid_t waitpid(pid_t pid, int* statusp, int options);
```

By default this function will suspend (*wait*) for the process(es) in the `waitset` to finish and then resume. 

The `wait(int* statusp)` call is the simpler version of this.

> Class question; explain the arguments for `wait()`

We can put processes to sleep with `sleep()`.

## `Exec`
```c
int execve(const char *filename, const char *argv[], const char *envp[]);
```

This function runs `filename` with `argv`s. If it does not find the file it will return else it will not return. 

The `evcp` is a key:value array with environment variables.

## `fork` + `execve` combo
Shells and web servers use this combo a lot. The `&` works in the shell by creating a child process of the shell (fork) and running the relevant command inside of there using exec. If not the shell will wait for that program to finish.
