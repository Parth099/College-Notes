# Min Spanning Tree

A Minimum Spanning Tree is a tree that is derived from a graph $G=(V, E)$ such that it uses all the nodes in $V$ but only selects the edges $\in E$ s.t all the nodes are connected with the lowest total cost. 

This is **not** to be confused with a shortest path algorithm which presents a path from $A\to B$ using the smallest cost. While [[01 - Kruskal's Algorithm]] and [[02 - Prim's Algorithm]] are MST algorithms, [[02 - Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm]] is not.

Consider a graph $G$ where:

$$
\begin{align}
x &\to y = 2 \\
x &\to z = 2 \\
y &\to z = 1
\end{align}
$$

$T_1$ (left) will be generated by Dijkstra's Algorithm if we choose $x$ as the starting node. However that is **not** the correct MST since $T_2$ (right) connects all edges via a cost of 3.
