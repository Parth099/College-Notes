## Programming Vs. Software Development
### Programming
***Input Output Model***: All computing can be represented as transforming **input data** into **outputs**. 

![iomodel](../img/io_model.png)

***Evaluation***:
+ Speed
	+ $O(f(n))$
	+ TPS (transactions per second)
+ Memory Usage
+ Precision/Recall

### Software Development

+ Multiple People working on one project

***Evaluation***:
+ Fit for purpose (how happy is the client)
+ Usability (how hard is it for a person to use)
+ Cost 
+ Delay

In the end **Software Development** is writing a set of programs to solve business requirements whilst **Computer Programming** is writing a sequence of instructions to transform input into (desired) output.
