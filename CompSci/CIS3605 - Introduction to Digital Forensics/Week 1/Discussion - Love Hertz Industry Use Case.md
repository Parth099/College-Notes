# Love Hertz Industry Use Case
## Background Summary 
First, a user reported being defrauded on craigslist. They bought a car that "checked out" on paper yet was owned by a rental car company. After investigation and cross-checking, investigators found that this incident had occurred a few times before, and each time, the ads posted on seller websites followed a template. Investigators obtained the IPs for posters of the ads, which allowed them to get the home addresses of the scammers. 

Investigators contacted the publishers of the ads and met them to perform surveillance but not arrest them yet. Investigators also contacted rental car services to see who was renting these stolen cars. The investigators were also able to find the social media accounts of these sellers and subsequently determined some locations scams were taking place. Enough evidence was collected to indict thirty-four people that collectively committed two million USD in fraud damages. 

Investigators then obtained warrants for phones, tablets, computers, etc., and seized them. The devices were then analyzed by a digital forensic lab to find evidence of fraudulent activity regardless of deleted status. 

## Questions
### Q2
> Describe parts of the anecdotal story and give examples where you recognize these Digital Forensics investigative methodology:
> +  Identification of evidence  
> + Collection of evidence  
> + Examination of evidence  
> + analysis of data or evidence

####  Identification of evidence  
The evidence was identified when someone that was scammed reported it. The possibility of the existence of the evidence was solidified when investigators saw that many of the other ads followed a similar format to the original one. 

#### Collection of evidence  
The evidence was collected at a few points:
+ IPs were collected from the seller platform, which led to the sellers' location
+ Recordings of sellers in rental car shops were obtained
+ devices were seized for forensic analysis

#### Examination of evidence 
This occurred when the seized devices were thoroughly combed for material linking suspects to the crime. They looked at the photos and locations of the phone based on connected cellular towers. 

#### analysis of data or evidence
The suspects were found guilty when digital evidence linked them to locations they proclaimed never to be in. 

### Q4
I was quite curious about this question, but I was not fully able to find the answer I was looking for.

So Colin talks about how they can procure devices in the whole house regardless of the ownership of the devices. In other words, the police can seize devices the suspect does not own but may be related to them. 

I think this falls under **[Probable Cause](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/probable_cause)**, which is found in the 4th amendment. It says there must be a reasonable basis for believing a crime has been committed. However, I am unsure if this law can apply to digital devices since they may contain private information not relating to the crime. 

Let me know if there are any precedents or laws that you find that establish this.
