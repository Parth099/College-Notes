You can see the content in hex, or see and retrieve the content documents, pictures, attachments, etc.  Autopsy will create a timeline of system changes and a forensic report. - Module 2 Intro

+ Configure relevant inject modules
	+ these are the things you want to analyze (emails, photo recovery...)
