# STELLA QUIZ
## Question 1
> What is Jeroen Lee's email address?

I found this answer in the email regex matcher provide by Autopsy. It had 19 occurrences so I was sure this was the correct answer: `Jeroen.Lee@twobirds.com`.

## Question 2
> I found less that 5 instances of Joroen's email address.  In what language(s) were the email body or email message written?

At least 5 files that reference the email have the *German* in the title and reference Joroen's email address. This was provided in the same page that all the emails where listed. I just had to look at which documents reference his email I found in $Q1$.

## Question 3
Each file has a pane for meta information. I click on the pane and I was able to see:
+ Hashes
+ Access / Modify times
+ Email was listed in the word doc meta descrip under author
+ size was under general meta information

## Question 4 and 5

To find the Phone numbers($Q4$) and URLs($Q5$) I simply iterated over the list generated by the regex finder that autopsy has. 

### Phone Numbers

### URLs

## Question 6
> What is the file path for the file `MapSettings.cfg`?

Searched by keyword `MapSettings.cfg` and this file was the first in the last. The path was obtained from the File-Metadata

## Question 7
![[house_at_address.png]]

This is the house at the address `Glen Falls Ct7Glen Falls Ct 901, Newark DE`, which is found in `/img_tomtom-1.img/USA_and_Canada/MapSettings.cfg`.

It is simple a house address. Seems to be in the suburbs. 

## Question 8
> Search for IP addresses in the `tomtom.img` media.  List the IP address(es) found, if any.

There does not exist any IP addresses **but** autopsy does match some patters that *could* be IPs. Upon closer inspection I saw that they were just version numbers and image encodings.

## Question 9
> When you searched for phone numbers, how many times or instances was the phone number found?

![phone_number_instances](/img/phone_number_instances.png)

The answer should be 3, since three unique *text files* contain it, however it appears in a OS image file this person keeps. So the phone numbers appear 3 times but they also appear in a image file so the answer should be 4.
