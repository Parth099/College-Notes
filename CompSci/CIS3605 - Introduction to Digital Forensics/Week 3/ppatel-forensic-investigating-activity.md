# Finding Evidence
## Selecting the Correct Drive

I noticed that 	`/Essay/text.txt` had the same text but with only two words changed. I checked using [this](https://www.diffchecker.com/diff). The word `Matthew` was added along with the word `Michael` being changed to `Marco`.

This makes me think Michael may have done this to frame the other two. After seeing HDB mentioned two times in the `textDump.txt` i have chosen that drive to look into. It also helps that it is the largest drive out of the three. 

## Questions
I opened drive B to path `/img_Hard Drive B.001/USBCocktails&OysterMenu`. 

### Q1:
![marco_clockout.png](/img/marco_clockout.png)

I found a file named `timeStamp.txt` which had Marco's timestamps. It says that Marco clocked out at **10:00 PM** on 3/21 .

### Q2:
![marco_building_report](/img/marco_building_report.png)
This image on this drive had the daily schedule on it. Assuming it is Marco's, he is reporting to **Building B** after dinner.
