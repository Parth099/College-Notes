# Chapter 3 - Labs and tools 
## Forensic Labs
The majority of Forensic labs are run by govt. agencies. Because digital forensic tools are not cheap, many cannot afford to create and train labs. However with today's technology labs can be run virtually. This virtual approach allows for role based access. 

### Lab Security
+ Access to lab facilities must be carefully restrictive
+ Must address natural events like fires and floods
+ Apply chain of custody from [[Chapter 1 - Intro]]

A best practice is to remove the computer from the internet. Moreover a storage device that must be examined cannot be connected to the mainframe, it may contain malware. 

### Evidence Storage
Evidence **must** be kept secure. This can be in the form of a data safe which can protect the storage medium from its weakness like heat or EMP. Always apply chain of custody. 

Design SOPs(Standard Operating Procedures) to outline the guidelines of doing forensics. 

### Quality Assurance (QA)

> *Quality assurance* is defined as “a well-documented system of protocols used to assure the accuracy and reliability of analytical results” (James and Nordby, 2009). - From the Textbook


**Examples:** 
+ peer review
+ evidence handling 
+ case documentation
+ proper training
+ $\dotso$

The review process is divided into two parts. 
1. Technical Review
	+ focuses on the results (*completed by separate*  **examiner** )
2. Administrative Review
	+ focuses on the paperwork completion

#### proficiency testing
A forensic examiner's competency must be tested regularly. This is done with *mock evidence*. 

**Test Types**:
1. Open Test
	+	Awareness of test
2. Blind Test
	+	not \#1
3. Internal and external tests
	+ Internal means the tests are conducted by the agency itself

These tests are completed to ensure evidence presented in the court is admissible WRT to the examiner .  

### Tool Validation
Much like the examiner, tools must also be validated. You should not just take the manufacturer’s word for it. 

#### Documentation

> "if you didn't write it down it didn't happen"

The procedure for documentation is laid out in the agency's SOPs. 
One measure to help guide the documentation process is **forms**. They help personnel complete tasks correctly by describing and processing the evidence correctly. 

The **final report** of an examiner is the formal document delivered to prosecutors. It contains details about who/what/when/how performed the examination. It is important to consider the audience for this document, usually non-technical people. 

## Digital Forensic Tools
We can perform validation by using many tools to arrive at the same result. Orgs like NIST(National Institute of Standards) and NIJ establish guidelines and help validate tools for use. 

Due to the volume of data a lab often requires vary capable hardware. 

## Accreditation
This is an endorsement of a crime lab’s policies and procedures. The American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors/Laboratory Accreditation Board (ASCLD/LAB) is recognized as a world leader in the accreditation of forensic laboratories. 

> Accreditation is lab based while certification is examiner based.
