## Market Player

Market Players - Anyone who partakes in the financial market[^1] such as:
+ Institutional Investors (*Smart Money*): Goldman, JPMC, Citadel, ...
+ Retail Investors (*Dumb Money*): Robinhood users ðŸ¤£, r/WallStreetBets, ...

Market players are Speculators, Hedgers or Arbitrageurs. The goal for the hedger is to minimize the risk in their large portfolio. Arbitrageurs long and short financial instruments at the same time for one or more financial instruments that should stay similarly priced. 

A Market maker is someone who has lots of money[^2] meaning they can influence the market heavily. A Market taker is someone who just sells and buys at market price and cannot really influence the market, this is the difference. A market maker will not buy and sell if they cannot make a profit. 

Example: Suppose there are lots shoe sellers but not many buyers. A Market maker can buy all the shows and store them allowing more buyers to come out and buy. This creates an efficient market where both buyers and sellers can be balanced without being equal in numbers. The market maker will wait for higher demand by reselling the shoes, however, they also hold the risk. 

Market players can also be classified by their side. Buy side simply makes money by buying and investing large portions of securities for the purpose of money or fund management. Sell side makes money by selling or promoting securities to the public.
