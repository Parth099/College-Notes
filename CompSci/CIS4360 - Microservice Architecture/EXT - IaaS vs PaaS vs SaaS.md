> SaaS: Software as a service

These are known as cloud application services. They are the most common type of service. It uses the internet to deliver the functionality of an app so you do not have to install it yourself. They **do not** run on your servers, they run on the provider's servers. 

This reduces the dev time on a project by reducing the time spent in tasks who's solutions already exist in the market. 

### Disadvantages
1. Vendor lock-in
2. Lack of integration support
3. Customization not always unique to find a user's needs.
4. You are handing the remote over to someone else. Their decisions may affect how your product performs.
