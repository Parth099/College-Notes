## Best Practices for Modern App Development
+ Componentize Apps via Microservices [[1 - Into To Microservices]]
+ Update and deploy fast with a automatic release pipeline 
+ Model and provision application resources using Infrastructure as code
+ Simply app using serverless tech
+ increase observability
+ automate security

## The Cloud
- Baremetal, virtual machines, and contains that can be pooled together as a *common* resource.

> Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user. Large clouds often have functions distributed over multiple locations, each location being a data center. Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and economies of scale, typically using a "pay-as-you-go" model...

### Essential Cloud Characteristics
1. On Demand self-service
	- Based on your demand (size, location, tech)
	- The cloud is providing: Computing Power, Storage and Networking
	- Spins up services on demand through some interface

2. Broad network access
	- Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms for any type of device. The network resource is perceived as infinite - provisioned and given by the cloud as a shared resource.

3. Resource Pooling
	-	The cloud provider's computing resources are pooled to serve **multiple** consumers at once, which physical and virtual resources *dynamically* allocated

4. Rapid Elasticity
	- can expand up or down in any resource 

5. Measured service
	-	control and monitoring by the cloud provider
	-	transparency with what a consumer uses and what they can scale
