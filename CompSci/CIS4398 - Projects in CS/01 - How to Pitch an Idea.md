# 01 - How to Pitch an Idea

## The Product Vision

+ Starting point for a software production development
+ Shorts Simple Statements that define the product to be developed 

## Pitches
### The \_\_ meets \_\_. 

Ex: `Spiderman meets the bee movie`.

### Moore's Template for a Vision

```
FOR (customer)
WHO (statement of need/opportunity)

The (product name)

THAT (key reason why products exists)
UNLIKE (primary competitive product)
OUR PRODUCT (main difference)
```

This answers the three target questions:

1. Who are the Target Customers?
2. What is the Product To be developed?
3. Why should customers buy this?
