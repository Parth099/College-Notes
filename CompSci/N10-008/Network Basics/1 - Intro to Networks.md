# Intro to Networks
Tags: #1_2

Networks are used to create connections between machines. An example is the connection between an iPhone and an Apple Watch (Bluetooth). This is a Personal Access Network. There are many types of networks today.

Before the modern era each Network had a purpose, like telephones or the internet. However in modern times, Networks have **converged** and one network can complete many actions.

A converged network will expect all types of traffic: emails, calls, streaming, ... 

Because of Network Convergence, we expect high uptime and speeds. Usually, a company will promise 99.999\% uptime: 5-mins of downtime/year.  This is the challenge of being a network engineer along with all the types of traffic you many receive in a modern converged network.
