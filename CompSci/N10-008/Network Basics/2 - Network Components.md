# Network Components
Tags: #2_1

The question to answer here is what comprises our network?
> **Network**: Networks are used to create connections between machines. 

## Components
1. Client - The end-user device. This *device* can be anything that can connect to the network
2. Server - A device that provides resources to the rest of the network
	+ Different server provide different functions. Think Email-server, chat-server or print-server.
	+ We can have Dedicated Hardware and Specialized Software

3. Hub - Older Tech that connects devices together. This system is uncommon now. 
	+ Hubs are often error prone. What a hub does is copy your message and sent it to all connections on the hub. A connection to the hub is *wired*, you are plugged into the physical port on it. This is problematic when the hub has a lot of users
	+ Note: You can connect hubs to other hubs to allow for more users.

4. Wireless Access Point (WAP)
	+	A device that allows wireless devices to connect into a wired network
	+	Wifi is a common WAP. 
	+	A WAP acts like a wireless *hub*

5. Switch ("Smart" Hub)
	+ A devices that connects together network devices together. This is the same thing a *hub* does.
	+ Unlike a hub, a switch can learn which device is on which hub and thus it does not have to send information to everyone. 	
	+ More Secure and Efficient than hub

6. Router
	+ A router connects two different networks together.
	+ Modern routers use IP addresses

7. Media - Connects two devices or a devices to a switch port.
	+ This can mean cables or radio waves for wireless networks 
	+ Each type of *Media* has benefits and downsides(limitations).

8. Wide Area Network (WAN) Link
	+ Physically connects two geographically different networks. This is one way to think about the internet.
	+ An example is connections in a home, it would **not** be possible to be able to connect to the outside world without a WAN link. 
	+ In short, it connects your *internal* network (router) to the *external* network (the world)
