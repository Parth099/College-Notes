# Network Resources
Tags: #1_2

Network Resources regards how data will move between machines and around the Network.

There are two models for this *movement*:
1. Client-Server Model
2. Peer-to-Peer Model (P2P)

> While reading about the two models notice how one's benefits refer to the other's drawbacks and vice-versa.

## Client Server Model
Uses a server to provide access to files and **devices** to people on the network. *Devices* are mean things like printers.

Since each resource is located one a single (or many) servers, Administration and backup is **much** easier. This model is also more scalable. 

However since we require dedicated hardware and OSs, the cost for this system is higher. Yet, this model dominates the business market today.

## P2P
This is when people on the network can share files directly. This makes Administration and backup *harder* due to redundancy. 

Yet, P2P does have benefits:
1. Low Cost
2. No dedicated resources

Drawbacks
1. Irregular uptime
2. decentralized management
3. inefficient for larger network sizes (more people)
4. poor scalability

In a word, P2Ps are *inconsistent*.
