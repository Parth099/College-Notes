# Advanced Types
## Intersection Types
### Intersection with Objects
```ts
type Admin = {
	name: string;
	privileges: string[];
};

type Employee = {
	name: string;
	startDate: Date;
};

type ElevatedEmployee = Admin & Employee;

const superEmp: ElevatedEmployee = {
	name: "Sim",
	privileges: ["elevator"],
	startDate: new Date(),
};
```
With Object types, `Admin` and `Employee`, their *intersection* (non-mathematical) **requires** that we define all properties both use. 

We can also do the same task with `interface` :
```ts
interface Admin = {
	name: string;
	privileges: string[];
};

interface Employee = {
	name: string;
	startDate: Date;
};

interface ElevatedEmployee extends Admin, Employee{}
```

### Intersection with *Core* Types
```ts
type Combinable = string | number;
type Numeric = number | boolean;

type Universal = Combinable & Numeric;

let p: Universal;
// p = "5"; -> error
// p = false; -> error
p = 5; //valid
```
With core types we see that the behavior of the `&` is actually closer to its mathematical definition. 

## Type Guards
> **Definition :**
> Checking if Props exist before accessing/using them.

Suppose we define a type as show below using Union Syntax
```ts
type JobDoer = Employee | Admin;
```
Then we want to define a method that prints `Worker` Name and privlages if there exists any.

```ts
function printEmpInfo(emp: JobDoer) {
	console.log(`Name: ${emp.name}`);
	console.log(`Privs: ${emp.privileges}`);
}
```
Since `TS` cannot guarantee that all `JobDoer`s have attr: privileges TS marks this as an issue. 

```ts
if(emp.privileges){
	console.log(`Privs: ${emp.privileges}`);
}
```
This causes another error.

The fix us using the JS `in` operator.
```ts
function printEmpInfo(emp: JobDoer) {
	console.log(`Name: ${emp.name}`);
	if ("privileges" in emp) {
		console.log(`Privs: ${emp.privileges}`);
	}
}
```
Same logic can be applied to the `startDate` prop.

Note For **Classes**:
If we want to run methods based on the type of class we can use 
```ts
if(objName instanceof ClsName){//...}
```
`instanceof` is a JavaScript operator.

## Discriminated Union Pattern
We learned from the last few sections that this is valid code.
*Note*: Recall that `interface` types are a valid type for variables.

```ts

interface Bird {
	flyingSpeed: number;
}

interface Cow {
	walkingSpeed: number;
}

type Animal = Bird | Cow;

function showSpeed(animal: Animal) {
	if ("flyingSpeed" in animal) {
		console.log(animal.flyingSpeed);
	}

	if ("walkingSpeed" in animal) {
		console.log(animal.walkingSpeed);
	}
}
```
This code works as intended but we can employ another pattern to make this more *elegant*.

### Discriminate Pattern
We can redesign the interface as such:
```ts
interface Bird {
	kind : "flier"; //Literal Type, this is a constant
	flyingSpeed: number;
}

interface Cow {
	kind : "walker"
	walkingSpeed: number;
}

type Animal = Bird | Cow;
```

and then the function as such
```ts
function showSpeed(animal: Animal) {
	let speed: number; //only numbers are valid speeds
	switch (animal.kind) {
		case "flier":
			speed = animal.flyingSpeed;
			break;
		case "walker":
			speed = animal.walkingSpeed;
			break;
	}
	console.log({ speed });
}
```
We can employ a switch as this allows `TS` to auto complete the `switch cases` for us, the compiler understands which cases are possible here.

Calling the function:
```ts
showSpeed({ kind: "flier", walkingSpeed: 5 }); //error
showSpeed({ kind: "flier", flyingSpeed: 5 });
```

## Type Casting
Suppose we have this in our HTML
```HTML
<body>
	<input type="text" name="" id="user-input" />
</body>
```

In our TS file we capture this `<p>` via 
```ts
const usrIn = document.querySelector("#user-input");
```
According to TS, our `para` is of type:
```ts
const usrIn: Element | null;
```
However we know for a fact that is of type `HTMLInput` . And we want to set its value via JS like this:
```ts
usrIn.value = "Type in this Field"; 
```
This **will** cause an error since TS cannot assume `usrIn.value` is a valid `usrIn` prop.

### Solution A
The first thing we will do is append the `!` to mark the element as non-`null` and then tell TS our real element type of `HTMLInputElement`

```ts
const usrIn = document.querySelector("#user-input")! as HTMLInputElement;
usrIn.value = "Type in this Field";
```

This code runs as *intended*.
 
 ### Solution B
```ts
const usrIn = <HTMLInputElement>document.querySelector("#user-input")!;
usrIn.value = "Type in this Field";
```

Both solutions work as intended, they are just different syntax. However, Solution B will clash with `JSX` code.

### Solution C - Type Casting Before Use
```ts
const usrIn = document.querySelector("#user-input");
if(usrIn){
	(usrIn as HTMLInputElement).value = "Type in this Field";
}
```
The type cast yields the proper type and thus we can utilize the `.value` property.

## Index Types
This is used to generate objects where we wont always be sure what properties will be used and which will not be used.

An Example of this is a `form` validation object. We can have many fields on the form and we will need to validate them before sending them off to a server. For example, the email, username, password and address must all be valid with respect to what they are. This means the email must be in the form of a real email. 

In short, using `Index-Types` we are sure of the type of the key but we are not sure the number of keys in the object. 

```ts
interface ErrorObj {
	[prop: string]: string;
}
```
This tells TS that we don not know the number of `props` but we know of the `string to string` mapping we need. 

Like a regular object we can add required keys like this:

```ts
interface ErrorObj {
	id: string; //
	[prop: string]: string;
}
```
*Note*: This extra required property **must be** as the same type as our index type.

This is perfect since we can use a `for in` loop to loop over errors defined by this `ErrorObj`.

Example of a Index-Type object creation:
```ts
let formErrors: ErrorObj;

formErrors = {
	id: "news-letter-form", //id of our dom element
	email: "not a valid email",
	zip: "not a valid zip code",
	//...
};
```

## Function Overloading
> **Note**
> The TS behavior for overloading is not the same as `Java`

Recall this amazing function from before:
```ts
type Combinable = string | number;
function add(a: Combinable, b: Combinable) {
	if (typeof a === "string" || typeof b === "string") {
		return a.toString() + b.toString();
	}
	return a + b; // both are ints
}
```

Suppose we attempt this:
```ts
const out = add("Expo", "Marker");
console.log(out.slice(4));
```

This causes an error since TS thinks the return type is 
```ts
Combinable = string | number; 
//.split is not present on number
```

We can fix this issue via overloading and telling under what circumstances the function returns what.

```ts
function add(a: string, b: string): string;//Line 1
function add(a: number, b: number): number;//2 more combos
function add(a: Combinable, b: Combinable) {
	if (typeof a === "string" || typeof b === "string") {
		return a.toString() + b.toString();
	}
	return a + b;
}
const out = add("Expo", "Marker");
console.log(out.slice(4)); //Marker
```

That is exactly the job of `Line 1` .

Overloading is quite flexible, we can even define behaviors for our function when one or more of the params are optional. 

## Generic Utility Types
These are builtin TS types that aid your coding. An example of this is the `Partial<Type>` type. 

It sets all of the properties of the object that is the `Type` to optional as sometimes values of an object cannot always be filled at compile time.

This we can construct an `interface`  and wrap it in `Partial` and use that to utilize any of the property fields it contains.
