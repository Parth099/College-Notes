# Generics
> **Note**:
> Some of the behavior of Generics in `TypeScript` is close to that of Java. 

## Examples of Existing Generics 
### The `Array`
```ts
const arr: Array<string> = ["s13", "s17", "s19"];
```
### The `Promise` API
```ts
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
	setTimeout(() => {
		resolve("This is completed");
	}, 2000); //2s
});
```

This promise via TS is of type `Promise<unknown>` when it really should be `Promise<string>` .
```ts
const promise: Promise<string> = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
	setTimeout(() => {
		resolve("This is completed");
	}, 2000); //2s
});
```

This may seem useless but it helps us keep our `Promise`s type-safe.
```ts
promise.then((v: string) => {
	console.log(v);
});
```
TS knows our argument `v` **must be** of type `string` and throws an error if any other type is used (except type `any`). Moreover, using `Promise<string>` we gain auto-complete.

> **Observation**: 
> Recall that when using `resolve` or `reject` we **cannot** *pass back* more than one value. We will have to use an object to do so. We can then use `interface`s to type check our promise state via `Promise<Interface_Name>`

## Generic Functions
```ts
function merge(ObjA: object, ObjB: object) {
	return Object.assign(ObjA, ObjB);
}
```
```ts
const merged = merge({ name: "Bobert" }, { job: "sleeping" });
merged.name; //error
merged.job; //error
```

Notice that TS will have a compile time error because it is not sure what attrs `merged` will have.

We can fix this with generics.
```ts
function merge<T, S>(ObjA: T, ObjB: S) {
    return Object.assign(ObjA, ObjB);
}

const merged = merge({ name: "Bobert" }, { job: "sleeping" });
merged.name; //valid
merged.job;  //valid
```

This is valid because now TS assumes the return type is `T & S` which is what we want. (intersection type - object). This is important because we let `T` and `S` be defined at `runtime` .

Note: `rtype: T & S` because that is the return type of `Object.assign`, the reason why it doesn't work with `object` is because it is not *specific* enough. 

### Restricting Generic Types  
Much like `Java` we will often require generic arguments to be of some general type. 

For example this code will execute without any errors: 
```ts
const merged = merge({ name: "Bobert" }, 10000);
merged.name; //valid
```

However we would prefer our `T` and `S` to at-least be of type object. We can get this behavior via
```ts
function merge<T extends object, S extends object>(ObjA: T, ObjB: S) {
    return Object.assign(ObjA, ObjB);
}

const merged = merge({ name: "Bobert" }, 10000); //error
```
This throws an error since `10000` is **not** a `object` type. 
> **Observation**: 
> We can use an `interface` to specify what props are required for some generic type `T` .

## `keyof` Operator
```ts
function getItem(obj: object, key: string) {
    return `Val: ${obj[key]}`;
}

console.log(getItem({ name: "Kris" }, "name"));
```

Notice how this causes an error because we cannot assume `obj["name"]` exists. We need to make sure that `key` is an element of `obj`

This is where `keyof` comes in:
```ts
function getItem<T extends object, S extends keyof T>(obj: T, key: S) {
    return `Val: ${obj[key]}`;
}

```
```ts
console.log(getItem({ name: "Kris" }, "name")); //valid
console.log(getItem({ name: "Kris" }, "bike")); //invalid
```

`keyof` is a type that can only take on values of the defined values in its parent object.

``` ts
S extends keyof T
```
This statement ensures that `S` is a element of `T` .
