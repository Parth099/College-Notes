# Software Development
## Incubate Method: Waterfall  
In Waterfall, we think about the problem long whilst also researching it very well. Then we step into development.

This is the most popular.

## Iterate Method: Agile
We wont spend too much time in dev-mode. Instead we will breakdown each problem/sub-problem in to its smallest problem and then get feedback.

There are Agile Values that wont be covered here.
The goal of *Agile* is learning from mistakes (bad feedback), ensuring a tight feedback loop between devs, business & end-users. And Lastly, building a product that is easy to adapt to business change.

### Defining Features
An Agile dev cycle is known as a *sprint*. In a sprint, priorities are translated from stakeholders to requirements. Each requirement is made into a ticket which is tracked over the dev cycle. The end of a sprint marks the start of a new Sprint where new roles are discussed. People also talk about what went well/not well. 

The leader of a *sprint* is known a as a *Scrum Master*.
There are also *stands up*, this is bypass the bureaucracies of Waterfall.  

## Agile VS WaterFall
Agile supports small updates and speed to up-time while Waterfall is more focused on quality and less bugs.
